These tools operate across the analysis pipeline doing everything from assessing quality control to matching peptides to spectra to quantification. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these tools are not able to operate directly on the proprietary formats generated by the diverse mass spectrometers. Consequently, the first step in many protocols is the conversion of data from vendor-specific binary files to open-format files. This protocol details the use of ProteoWizard's msConvert and msConvertGUI software for this conversion, taking format features, coding options, and vendor particularities into account. We specifically describe the various options available when doing conversions and the implications of each option.},

Additionally, the effects of different strategies for controlling familywise error rate or false discovery and how they work with the different strategies for missing value imputation have been evaluated. Missing values were found to affect normality and variance of data and k-means nearest neighbour imputation was the best method tested for restoring this. Bonferroni correction was the best method for maximizing true positives and minimizing false positives and it was observed that as low as 40\% missing data could be truly missing. The range between 40 and 70\% missing values was defined as a ``gray area'' and therefore a strategy has been proposed that provides a balance between the optimal imputation strategy that was k-means nearest neighbor and the best approximation of positioning real zeros.},

While mass spectrometry-based (MS) metabolomics assays are endowed with high throughput and sensitivity, MWAS are doomed to long-term data acquisition generating an overtime-analytical signal drift that can hinder the uncovering of real biologically relevant changes. We developed "dbnorm", a package in the R environment, which allows for an easy comparison of the model performance of advanced statistical tools commonly used in metabolomics to remove batch effects from large metabolomics datasets. "dbnorm" integrates advanced statistical tools to inspect the dataset structure not only at the macroscopic (sample batches) scale, but also at the microscopic (metabolic features) level. To compare the model performance on data correction, "dbnorm" assigns a score that help users identify the best fitting model for each dataset. In this study, we applied "dbnorm" to two large-scale metabolomics datasets as a proof of concept. We demonstrate that "dbnorm" allows for the accurate selection of the most appropriate statistical tool to efficiently remove the overtime signal drift and to focus on the relevant biological components of complex datasets.},

  abstract = {Aliphatic glucosinolates are compounds which occur in high concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae species. They are important for the resistance of the plant to pest insects. Previously, the biosynthesis of these compounds was shown to be regulated by transcription factors MYB28 and MYB29. We now show that MYB28 and MYB29 are partially redundant, but in the absence of both, the synthesis of all aliphatic glucosinolates is blocked. Untargeted and targeted biochemical analyses of leaf metabolites showed that differences between single and double knock-out mutants and wild type plants were restricted to glucosinolates. Biosynthesis of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates was blocked by the myb28 mutation, while short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were reduced by about 50\% in both the myb28 and the myb29 single mutants. Most remarkably, all aliphatic glucosinolates were completely absent in the double mutant. Expression of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was slightly but significantly reduced by the single myb mutations, while the double mutation resulted in a drastic decrease in expression of these genes. Since the myb28myb29 double mutant is the first Arabidopsis genotype without any aliphatic glucosinolates, we used it to establish the relevance of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis to herbivory by larvae of the lepidopteran insect Mamestra brassicae. Plant damage correlated inversely to the levels of aliphatic glucosinolates observed in those plants: Larval weight gain was 2.6 fold higher on the double myb28myb29 mutant completely lacking aliphatic glucosinolates and 1.8 higher on the single mutants with intermediate levels of aliphatic glucosinolates compared to wild type plants.},

Previously we showed that EP3 is a functional orthologue of HWS. Here we demonstrate that OsFBK1 is another functional orthologue of HWS and show the complexity of interaction between EP3 and OsFBK1 genes at different developmental stages of the plant. qRT-PCR expression analyses and studies of EP3-GFP and OsFBK1-RFP promoter reporter lines demonstrate that although EP3 and OsFBK1 expression can be detected in the same tissues some cells exclusively express EP3 or OsFBK1 whilst others co-express both genes. Loss, reduction or gain-of-function lines for EP3 and OsFBK1, show that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect plant architecture, organ size, floral organ number and size, floral morphology, pollen viability, grain size and weight. We have identified the putative orthologue genes of the rice microRNA pathway for ORYZA SATIVA DAWDLE (OsDDL) and ORYZA SATIVA SERRATE (OsSE), and demonstrated that EP3 and OsFBK1 affect their transcript levels as well as those of CROWN ROOT DEFECT 1/ORYZA SATIVA Exportin-5 HASTY (CRD1/OsHST), ORYZA SATIVA DICER-LIKE 1 (OsDCL) and ORYZA SATIVA WEAVY LEAF1 (OsWAF1). We show that EP3 affects OsPri-MIR164, OsNAM1 and OsNAC1 transcript levels. OsNAC1 transcripts are modified by OsFBK1, suggesting two independent regulatory pathways, one via EP3 and OsMIR164 and the other via OsFBK1. Our data propose that EP3 and OsFBK1 conjointly play similar roles in rice to how HWS does in Arabidopsis.},

  abstract = {Despite the essential role of specialized metabolites (SMs) in the interaction of plants with the environment, studying the ability of crop seeds to produce these protective compounds has been neglected. Furthermore, seeds produce a myriad of SMs, providing an interesting model to investigate their diversity and plasticity. Camelina sativa gained a lot of interest in the past few years as a rustic oilseed crop. A characterization of seed SM landscapes in six camelina genotypes grown in the field and harvested during five growing seasons has been undertaken in this work. This allowed a comprehensive annotation of seed SMs combining analyses that cluster SMs based on their chemical structures and co-accumulation patterns. These data showed broad effects of the environment on the stimulation of the seed SM. Among well-annotated compounds, flavonols were identified as the metabolic class characterized by high plasticity, revealing significant variable accumulation according to the year and/or the genotype. Lastly, a deeper characterization of primary metabolites and lipids in two selected genotypes has been performed. We showed that, in addition to flavonols, alkaloids and glucosinolates displayed a higher phenotypic plasticity with respect to most of the primary metabolites, including some sugars and major storage compounds such as fatty acids, proteins and most lipid classes (e.g. diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols), but similar plasticity compared with free amino acids and carboxylic acids. This work highlighted major and unexplored effects of the environment on the seed SM, demonstrating that seeds exhibit a dynamic and plastic metabolism, with an impact on seed quality.},

Significant differences were noted among organs in both glucosinolate concentration and composition. Dormant and germinating seeds had the highest concentration (2.5\textendash 3.3\% by dry weight), followed by inflorescences, siliques (fruits), leaves and roots. While aliphatic glucosinolates predominated in most organs, indole glucosinolates made up nearly half of the total composition in roots and late-stage rosette leaves. Seeds had a very distinctive glucosinolate composition. They possessed much higher concentrations of several types of aliphatic glucosinolates than other organs, including methylthioalkyl and, hydroxyalkyl glucosinolates and compounds with benzoate esters than other organs. From a developmental perspective, older leaves had lower glucosinolate concentrations than younger leaves, but this was not due to decreasing concentrations in individual leaves with age (glucosinolate concentration was stable during leaf expansion). Rather, leaves initiated earlier in development simply had much lower rates of glucosinolate accumulation per dry weight gain throughout their lifetimes. During seed germination and leaf senescence, there were significant declines in glucosinolate concentration. The physiological and ecological significance of these findings is briefly discussed.},

As succinate triggers inflammatory changes in macrophages, we investigated the significance of succinate in the pathogenesis of AAD and its clinical relevance. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used untargeted metabolomics and mass spectrometry to determine plasma succinate concentrations in 40 and 1665 individuals of the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Three different murine AAD models were used to determine the role of succinate in AAD development. We further examined the role of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) and its transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB) in the context of macrophage-mediated inflammation and established p38{$\alpha$}MKOApoe-/- mice. Succinate was the most upregulated metabolite in the discovery cohort; this was confirmed in the validation cohort. Plasma succinate concentrations were higher in patients with AAD compared with those in healthy controls, patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Moreover, succinate administration aggravated angiotensin II-induced AAD and vascular inflammation in mice. In contrast, knockdown of OGDH reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in macrophages. The conditional deletion of p38{$\alpha$} decreased CREB phosphorylation, OGDH expression, and succinate concentrations. Conditional deletion of p38{$\alpha$} in macrophages reduced angiotensin II-induced AAD. CONCLUSION: Plasma succinate concentrations allow to distinguish patients with AAD from both healthy controls and patients with AMI or PE. Succinate concentrations are regulated by the p38{$\alpha$}-CREB-OGDH axis in macrophages.},

Then the assessment of each predictive variable's contribution to predictive models according to all latent factors was more precise than the conventional first one. Metabolites belonging to specific pathways were closely associated with yield heterosis, and the up-regulation of galactose metabolism promoted robust yield heterosis in hybrids under different growth conditions. Our study demonstrates that metabolome-based predictive models with correctly dissected population structure and screened predictive variables can facilitate accurate predictions of yield heterosis and have great potential for establishing molecular marker\textendash based precision breeding programs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In addition, every experiment is subject to within-platform and other experimental variation, which often includes unwanted biological variation. Such variation must be removed in order to focus on the biological information of interest. We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.},

  abstract = {Morchella sextelata is an edible and medicinal fungus with high nutritional, medicinal, and economic value. Recently, M. sextelata has been produced through artificial cultivation in China, but its stable production remains problematic because the details of its growth and development process are limitedly understood. Herein, to investigate the dynamic process of M. sextelata development, we integrated the transcriptomics and metabolomics data of M. sextelata from three developmental stages: the young mushroom period (YMP), marketable mature period (MMP), and physiological maturity period (PMP). The results showed that the transcriptome changed dynamically at different stages and demonstrated the significant enrichment of pathways that regulate plant growth and development, such as N-glycan biosynthesis and carbon and purine metabolism. Similarly, small-molecule metabolites, such as D-fructose-1,6-biphosphate, which was upregulated during the YMP, dihydromyricetin, which was upregulated during the MMP, and L-citrulline, which was upregulated during the PMP, also showed phase-dependent characteristics. Then, combined analysis of the transcriptome data and metabolome traits revealed that the transcriptome may affect metabolic molecules during different growth stages of M. sextelata via specific enzymes, such as {$\alpha$}-glucosidase and glucanase, which were included in two opposite transcriptome modules. In summary, this integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data for understanding the vegetative growth of M. sextelata during different developmental stages implicated several key genes, metabolites, and pathways involved in the vegetative growth. We believe that these findings will provide comprehensive insights into the dynamic process of growth and development in M. sextelata and new clues for optimizing the methods for its cultivation application.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics provides new insights into disease pathogenesis and biomarker discovery. Samples from large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies are typically analyzed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platform in several batches. Batch effects that are caused by non-biological systematic biases are unavoidable in large-scale metabolomics studies, even with properly designed experiments. The statistical analysis of large-scale metabolomics data without managing batch effects will yield misleading results. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, called WaveICA, which is based on the wavelet transform method with independent component analysis, as the threshold processing method to capture and remove batch effects for large-scale metabolomics data. The WaveICA method uses the time trend of samples over the injection order, decomposes the original data into multi-scale data with different features, extracts and removes the batch effect information in multi-scale data, and obtains clean data. The WaveICA method was tested on real metabolomics data. After applying the WaveICA method, scattered quality control samples (QCS) and subject samples in a PCA score plot of the original data were closely clustered, respectively. The average Pearson correlation coefficients for all peaks of the QCS increased from 0.872 to 0.972. Additionally, WaveICA significantly improved the classification accuracy for metabolomics data. The method was compared with three representative methods, and outperformed all of them. To conclude, WaveICA can efficiently remove batch effects while revealing more biological information. This method can be used in large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies to preprocess raw metabolomics data.},

We demonstrate the utility of this methodology on five proteomic datasets each encompassing hundreds of samples and consisting of multiple experimental designs. In conclusion, we provide guidelines and tools to make the extraction of true biological signal from large proteomic studies more robust and transparent, ultimately facilitating reliable and reproducible research in clinical proteomics and systems biology.},

In this scenario, understanding wild plant adaptations in extreme ecosystems offers an opportunity to learn about new mechanisms for resilience. Previous studies have shown species specificity for metabolites involved in plant adaptation to harsh environments. Here, we combined multispecies ecological metabolomics and machine learning-based generalized linear model predictions to link the metabolome to the plant environment in a set of 24 species belonging to 14 families growing along an altitudinal gradient in the Atacama Desert. Thirty-nine common compounds predicted the plant environment with 79\% accuracy, thus establishing the plant metabolome as an excellent integrative predictor of environmental fluctuations. These metabolites were independent of the species and validated both statistically and biologically using an independent dataset from a different sampling year. Thereafter, using multiblock predictive regressions, metabolites were linked to climatic and edaphic stressors such as freezing temperature, water deficit and high solar irradiance. These findings indicate that plants from different evolutionary trajectories use a generic metabolic toolkit to face extreme environments. These core metabolites, also present in agronomic species, provide a unique metabolic goldmine for improving crop performances under abiotic pressure.},

A study was conducted with the following objectives: (i) to determine if exotic tropical maize germplasm (TRMG) can increase diversity of Chinese maize germplasm for grain yield and five yield component traits (YCTs), namely, ear length (EL), ear diameter (ED), number of kernel rows per ear (RE), number of kernels per row (KR), and 1000-kernel weight (TKW), and (ii) to estimate general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects to identify a possible new heterotic pattern. Twenty-five temperate maize germplasm (TEMG) from both China and the United States were crossed with four TRMG from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The 100 testcrosses were evaluated in field trials for grain yield and five YCTs at three locations in Yunnan, China. Tropical lines YML146 and YML145 showed, in crosses with most of the TEMG, significant positive SCA effects for grain yield and most of the YCTs, indicating that these lines had a different genetic base from that of TEMG and could increase genetic diversity of Chinese maize germplasm. The GCA effects were more important and reliable than SCA effects for heterotic pattern classification. Exotic line YML146 (derived from Suwan1) was identified as a new heterotic group, different from Reid, Lancaster, Tangsipingtou (TSPT), and Luda Red Cob (LDRC). A new heterotic pattern of temperate \texttimes{} Suwan1 was postulated, which could be as important as the widely accepted flint \texttimes{} dent heterotic pattern.},

Technical data variance can obscure the true biological signal and hinder biological discoveries. To combat this issue, we present a novel normalization approach based on using quality control pool samples (QC). This method is called systematic error removal using random forest (SERRF) for eliminating the unwanted systematic variations in large sample sets. We compared SERRF with 15 other commonly used normalization methods using six lipidomics data sets from three large cohort studies (832, 1162, and 2696 samples). SERRF reduced the average technical errors for these data sets to 5\% relative standard deviation. We conclude that SERRF outperforms other existing methods and can significantly reduce the unwanted systematic variation, revealing biological variance of interest.},

In total, 257 (80.06\%), 363 (58.74\%), 351 (79.95\%), 242 (54.50\%), and 244 (46.30\%) nonadditively expressed proteins were identified in hybrids Zhengdan 958, Nongda 108, Yuyu 22, Xundan 20, and Xundan 18, respectively. The nonadditive proteins were divided into above high-parent (++; 811, 55.66\%), high-parent (+; 121, 8.30\%), partial dominance (+-; 249, 17.09\%), low-parent (-; 30, 2.06\%), below low-parent (- -; 62, 4.26\%), and D (different; 184, 12.63\%) expression patterns. The observed patterns indicate the important roles of dominance, partial dominance, and overdominance in regulating seed germination in maize. Additionally, 54 different proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and classified into nine functional groups: metabolism (9), cell detoxification (8), unknown functional proteins (8), chaperones (7), signal transduction (6), development process (5), other (5), transporter (3), and stress response (3). Of these, the most interesting are those involved with germination-related hormone signal transduction and the abscisic acid and gibberellin regulation networks.},

With the rapidly increasing amount of data generated, the need for streamlining analyses becomes more apparent. Proteomics data is known to be often affected by systemic bias from unknown sources, and failing to adequately normalize the data can lead to erroneous conclusions. To allow researchers to easily evaluate and compare different normalization methods via a user-friendly interface, we have developed ``proteiNorm''. The current implementation of proteiNorm accommodates preliminary filters on peptide and sample levels followed by an evaluation of several popular normalization methods and visualization of the missing value. The user then selects an adequate normalization method and one of the several imputation methods used for the subsequent comparison of different differential expression methods and estimation of statistical power. The application of proteiNorm and interpretation of its results are demonstrated on two tandem mass tag multiplex (TMT6plex and TMT10plex) and one label-free spike-in mass spectrometry example data set. The three data sets reveal how the normalization methods perform differently on different experimental designs and the need for evaluation of normalization methods for each mass spectrometry experiment. With proteiNorm, we provide a user-friendly tool to identify an adequate normalization method and to select an appropriate method for differential expression analysis.},

DNA methylation associated with 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs exhibits transallelic effects in hybrids of Arabidopsis and other species. Some of the transmethylation changes are inherited and some affect gene expression. Hybrids have larger leaves than those of the parents and have increases in cell size and number. The increased leaf size results in a greater photosynthetic capacity, which may support the increased vegetative and reproductive yields of the F1 hybrids. Genes and metabolic pathways that have altered expression relative to the parents include loci involved in responses to hormones and to biotic and abiotic stress. Whereas epigenetically induced changes in gene expression may contribute to hybrid vigor, the link between the transcriptional changes and the hybrid phenotype is not confirmed. Recurrent selection of high yielding F1 lines from the F2/F3 of a number of crops has fixed heterosis yields in pure breeding lines. These hybrid-like lines may have valuable applications in crop systems.},

However, transcriptome-scale networks tend to be highly connected, making it challenging for the hierarchical clustering underlying the WGCNA-based classification to discriminate coherently expressed gene sets without significant information loss from either a priori filtering of the expression dataset or a posteriori pruning of the cluster dendrogram. Here we present iterativeWGCNA, a Python-wrapped extension for the WGCNA R software package that improves the robustness of detected modules and minimizes information loss. The method works by pruning poorly fitting genes from estimated modules and then re-running WGCNA to refine gene clusters. After refining, pruned genes are assembled into a new expression dataset to isolate overlapping modules and the process repeated. In doing so, iterativeWGCNA provides an unsupervised, non-biased filtering to generate a robust, comprehensive network-based classification of whole-transcriptome expression datasets.},

Underlying drought responses are circadian and diel control of gene expression that regulate daily variations in metabolic and physiological pathways. To identify transcriptomic changes that occur in the crop Brassica rapa during initial perception of drought, we applied a co-expression network approach to associate rhythmic gene expression changes with physiological responses. Coupled analysis of transcriptome and physiological parameters over a two-day time course in control and drought-stressed plants provided temporal resolution necessary for correlation of network modules with dynamic changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, and photosystem II efficiency. This approach enabled the identification of drought-responsive genes based on their differential rhythmic expression profiles in well-watered versus droughted networks and provided new insights into the dynamic physiological changes that occur during drought.},

The aim of this study was to investigate how different chemical and physical factors (extraction solvent, derivatization reagents, and temperature) affect the extraction and derivatization of the metabolome from leaves of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Using design of experiment procedures, variation was systematically introduced, and the effects of this variation were analyzed using regression models. The results show that this approach allows a reliable protocol for metabolomic analysis of Arabidopsis to be determined with a relatively limited number of experiments. Following two different investigations an extraction and derivatization protocol was chosen. Further, the reproducibility of the analysis of 66 endogenous compounds was investigated, and it was shown that both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds were detected with high reproducibility.},

For humans these compounds function as cancer-preventing agents, biopesticides, and flavor compounds. Since the completion of the Arabidopsis genome, glucosinolate research has made significant progress, resulting in near-complete elucidation of the core biosynthetic pathway, identification of the first regulators of the pathway, metabolic engineering of specific glucosinolate profiles to study function, as well as identification of evolutionary links to related pathways. Although much has been learned in recent years, much more awaits discovery before we fully understand how and why plants synthesize glucosinolates. This may enable us to more fully exploit the potential of these compounds in agriculture and medicine.},

One key way in which the gut microbiome influences host physiology is through the production of small molecules1-3, yet progress in elucidating this chemical interplay has been hindered by limited tools calibrated to detect the products of anaerobic biochemistry in the gut. Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microorganism strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Using this metabolomics resource, we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover a previously undescribed~type of metabolism in Bacteroides,~and reveal candidate biochemical pathways using comparative genomics. Microbiota-dependent metabolites can be detected in diverse biological fluids from gnotobiotic and conventionally colonized mice and traced back to the corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria. Collectively, our microbiome-focused metabolomics pipeline and interactive metabolomics profile explorer are a powerful tool for characterizing microorganisms and interactions between microorganisms and their host.},

In this work, we applied multiple mass spectrometry techniques to identify metabolites involved in the FER signaling pathway and to understand their biological roles. A direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR)-MS approach was used for initial screening of wild-type and feronia (fer) mutant plant extracts, and Arabidopsides were found to be significantly enriched in the mutant. As Arabidopsides are known to be induced by wounding, further experiments on wounded and non-wounded leaf samples were carried out to investigate these oxylipins as well as related phytohormones using a quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS by direct injection and LC-MS/MS. In a root growth bioassay with Arabidopside A isolated from fer mutants, the wild-type showed significant root growth inhibition compared with the fer mutant. Our results therefore implicated Arabidopsides, and Arabidopside A specifically, in FER functions and/or signaling. Finally, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to visualize the localization of Arabidopsides, and we confirmed that Arabidopsides are highly abundant at wounding sites in both wild-type and fer mutant leaves. More significantly, five micron high-spatial resolution MALDI-MSI revealed that Arabidopsides are localized to the chloroplasts where many stress signaling molecules are made.},

Global metabolic profiling by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS), liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS), and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) was performed on rye plants, and the acquired data were analyzed using uni- and multivariate statistics. Targeted analysis showed that a high level of competition reduced the concentration of aglycone benzoxazinoids (BXs) and increased glycoside BXs in rye roots. Untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated an increase in the rye root content of the allelopathic compounds 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and uracil in response to competition. Untargeted analysis of rye shoots revealed that the plant competition increased the d-pyroglutamic acid, which is an elicitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

  abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a fatal gynecologic cancer, and its poor prognosis is mainly due to delayed diagnosis. Therefore, biomarker identification and prognosis prediction are crucial in EOC. Altered cell metabolism is a characteristic feature of cancers, and metabolomics reflects an individual's current phenotype. In particular, plasma metabolome analyses can be useful for biomarker identification. In this study, we analyzed 624 metabolites, including uremic toxins (UTx) in plasma derived from 80 patients with EOC using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Compared with the healthy control, we detected 77 significantly increased metabolites and 114 significantly decreased metabolites in EOC patients. Especially, decreased concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylcholines and increased concentrations of triglycerides were observed, indicating a metabolic profile characteristic of EOC patients. After calculating the parameters of each metabolic index, we found that higher ratios of kynurenine to tryptophan correlates with worse prognosis in EOC patients. Kynurenine, one of the UTx, can affect the prognosis of EOC. Our results demonstrated that plasma metabolome analysis is useful not only for the diagnosis of EOC, but also for predicting prognosis with the variation of UTx and evaluating response to chemotherapy.},

In recent years proteomics has been intensively applied to identify proteins involved in shaping the three-dimensional architecture and regulating the function of the maize root system. With the help of developmental mutants, proteomic changes during the initiation and emergence of shoot-borne, lateral and seminal roots have been examined. Furthermore, root hairs were surveyed to understand the proteomic changes during the elongation of these single cell type structures. In addition, primary roots have been used to study developmental changes of the proteome but also to investigate the proteomes of distinct tissues such as the meristematic zone, the elongation zone as well as stele and cortex of the differentiation zone. Moreover, subcellular fractions of the primary root including cell walls, plasma membranes and secreted mucilage have been analyzed. Finally, the superior vigor of hybrid seedling roots compared to their parental inbred lines was studied on the proteome level. In summary, these studies provide novel insights into the complex proteomic interactions of the elaborate maize root system during development.},

The genome sequence of the reference genotype, B73, representative of the stiff stalk heterotic group was recently updated (AGPv4) using long-read sequencing and optical mapping technology. To facilitate the use of AGPv4 and to enable functional genomic studies and association of genotype with phenotype, we determined expression abundances for replicated mRNA-sequencing datasets from 79 tissues and five abiotic/biotic stress treatments revealing 36~207 expressed genes. Characterization of the B73 transcriptome across six organs revealed 4154 organ-specific and 7704 differentially expressed (DE) genes following stress treatment. Gene co-expression network analyses revealed 12 modules associated with distinct biological processes containing 13~590 genes providing a resource for further association of gene function based on co-expression patterns. Presence-absence variants (PAVs) previously identified using whole genome resequencing data from 61 additional inbred lines were enriched in organ-specific and stress-induced DE genes suggesting that PAVs may function in phenological variation and adaptation to environment. Relative to core genes conserved across the 62 profiled inbreds, PAVs have lower expression abundances which are correlated with their frequency of dispersion across inbreds and on average have significantly fewer co-expression network connections suggesting that a subset of PAVs may be on an evolutionary path to pseudogenization. To facilitate use by the community, we developed the Maize Genomics Resource website (maize.plantbiology.msu.edu) for viewing and data-mining these resources and deployed two new views on the maize electronic Fluorescent Pictograph Browser (bar.utoronto.ca/efp\_maize).},

They are found mainly in the family Brassicaceae, which includes several important crops. More than 120 different glucosinolates are known. The enzyme myrosinase, which is stored in specialized plant cells, converts glucosinolates to the toxic isothiocyanates. Insect herbivores may reduce the toxicity of glucosinolates and their products by excretion, detoxification, or behavioral adaptations. Glucosinolates also affect higher trophic levels, via reduced host or prey quality or because specialist herbivores may sequester glucosinolates for their own defense. There is substantial quantitative and qualitative variation between plant genotypes, tissues, and ontogenetic stages, which poses specific challenges to insect herbivores. Even though glucosinolates are constitutive defenses, their levels are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors including insect damage. Plant breeders may use knowledge on glucosinolates to increase insect resistance in Brassica crops. State-of-the-art techniques, such as mutant analysis and metabolomics, are necessary to identify the exact role of glucosinolates.},

Whether HOPS and CORVET control endomembrane trafficking in pollen tubes, the fastest growing plant cells, remains largely elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the four core components shared by the two complexes, Vacuole protein sorting 11 (VPS11), VPS16, VPS33, and VPS18, are all essential for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis thaliana and thus for plant reproduction success. We used VPS18 as a representative core component of the complexes to show that the protein is localized to both multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the tonoplast in a growing pollen tube. Mutant vps18 pollen tubes grew more slowly in vivo, resulting in a significant reduction in male transmission efficiency. Additional studies revealed that membrane fusion from MVBs to vacuoles is severely compromised in vps18 pollen tubes, corroborating the function of VPS18 in late endocytic trafficking. Furthermore, vps18 pollen tubes produce excessive exocytic vesicles at the apical zone and excessive amounts of pectin and pectin methylesterases in the cell wall. In conclusion, this study establishes an additional conserved role of HOPS/CORVET in homotypic membrane fusion during vacuole biogenesis in pollen tubes and reveals a feedback regulation of HOPS/CORVET in the secretion of cell wall modification enzymes of rapidly growing plant cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hybridization is a prominent process in the evolution of crop plants that can give rise to gene expression variation, phenotypic novelty and heterosis. Maize is the most successful crop in utilizing heterosis. The development of hybrid maize ears exhibits strong heterotic vigor and greatly affects maize yield. However, a comprehensive perspective on transcriptional variation and its correlation with heterosis during maize ear development is not available. RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing technology, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of maize ears in the spikelet and floret differentiation stages of hybrid ZD808 and its parents CL11 and NG5. Our results revealed that 53.9\% (21,258) of maize protein-coding genes were transcribed in at least one genotype. In both development stages, significant numbers of genes were differentially expressed between the hybrid and its parents. Gene expression inheritance analysis revealed approximately 80\% of genes were expressed additively, which suggested that the complementary effect may play a foundation role in maize ear heterosis. Among non-additively expressed genes, NG5-dominant genes were predominant. Analyses of the allele-specific gene expression in hybrid identified pervasive allelic imbalance and significant preferential expression of NG5 alleles in both developmental stages. The results implied that NG5 may provide beneficial alleles that contribute greatly to heterosis. Further comparison of parental and hybrid allele-specific expression suggested that gene expression variation is largely attributable to cis-regulatory variation in maize. The cis-regulatory variations tend to preserve the allelic expression levels in hybrid and result in additive expression. Comparison between the two development stages revealed that allele-specific expression and cis-/trans-regulatory variations responded differently to developmental cues, which may lead to stage-specific vigor phenotype during maize ear development. CONCLUSION: Our research suggests that cis-regulated additive expression may fine-tune gene expression level into an optimal status and play a foundation role in maize ear heterosis. Our work provides a comprehensive insight into transcriptional variation and its correlation with heterosis during maize ear development. The knowledge gained from this study presents novel opportunity to improve our maize varieties.},

  abstract = {The apple tree (Malus sp.) is an agriculturally and economically important source of food and beverages. Many of the health beneficial properties of apples are due to (poly)phenolic metabolites that they contain, including various dihydrochalcones. Although many of the genes and enzymes involved in polyphenol biosynthesis are known in many plant species, the specific reactions that lead to the biosynthesis of the dihydrochalcone precursor, p-dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA (3), are unknown. To identify genes involved in the synthesis of these metabolites, existing genome databases of the Rosaceae were screened for apple genes with significant sequence similarity to Arabidopsis alkenal double bond reductases. Herein described are the isolation and characterization of a Malus hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase, which catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of p-coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA to p-dihydrocoumaroyl-CoA and dihydroferuloyl-CoA, respectively. Its apparent Km values for p-coumaroyl-CoA, feruloyl-CoA and NADPH were 96.6, 92.9 and 101.3{$\mu$}M, respectively. The Malus double bond reductase preferred feruloyl-CoA to p-coumaroyl-CoA as a substrate by a factor of 2.1 when comparing catalytic efficiencies in vitro. Expression analysis of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase gene revealed that its transcript levels showed significant variation in tissues of different developmental stages, but was expressed when expected for involvement in dihydrochalcone formation. Thus, the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase appears to be responsible for the reduction of the {$\alpha$},{$\beta$}-unsaturated double bond of p-coumaroyl-CoA, the first step of dihydrochalcone biosynthesis in apple tissues, and may be involved in the production of these compounds.},

F-box proteins are key components of the ubiquitin proteasome system that allows targeted protein degradation. Transcriptome analyses indicate that half of these F-box protein genes are found expressed in microspore and/or pollen, i.e., during male gametogenesis. To assess the role of F-box protein genes during this crucial developmental step, we selected 34 F-box protein genes recorded as highly and specifically expressed in pollen and isolated corresponding insertion mutants. We checked the expression level of each selected gene by RT-PCR and confirmed pollen expression for 25 genes, but specific expression for only 10 of the 34 F-box protein genes. In addition, we tested the expression level of selected F-box protein genes in 24 mutant lines and showed that 11 of them were null mutants. Transmission analysis of the mutations to the progeny showed that none of the single mutations was gametophytic lethal. These unaffected transmission efficiencies suggested leaky mutations or functional redundancy among F-box protein genes. Cytological observation of the gametophytes in the mutants confirmed these results. Combinations of mutations in F-box protein genes from the same subfamily did not lead to transmission defect either, further highlighting functional redundancy and/or a high proportion of pseudogenes among these F-box protein genes.},

The F-box protein family plays a crucial role in plant growth and development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, systematic analysis of the F-box family in maize (Zea mays) has not been reported yet. In this paper, we identified and characterised the maize F-box genes in a genome-wide scale, including phylogenetic analysis, chromosome distribution, gene structure, promoter analysis and gene expression profiles. A total of 359 F-box genes were identified and divided into 15 subgroups by phylogenetic analysis. The F-box domain was relatively conserved, whereas additional motifs outside the F-box domain may indicate the functional diversification of maize F-box genes. These genes were unevenly distributed in ten maize chromosomes, suggesting that they expanded in the maize genome because of tandem and segmental duplication events. The expression profiles suggested that the maize F-box genes had temporal and spatial expression patterns. Putative cis-acting regulatory DNA elements involved in abiotic stresses were observed in maize F-box gene promoters. The gene expression profiles under abiotic stresses also suggested that some genes participated in stress responsive pathways. Furthermore, ten genes were chosen for quantitative real-time PCR analysis under drought stress and the results were consistent with the microarray data. This study has produced a comparative genomics analysis of the maize ZmFBX gene family that can be used in further studies to uncover their roles in maize growth and development.},

Early resistance is mediated by the bone marrow microenvironment, which protects residual leukemia cells. Over time, leukemia cells evolve intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, or late resistance. We mechanistically define both early and late resistance by integrating whole-exome sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, metabolomics, proteomics, and pharmacologic approaches. Early resistant cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, grow more slowly, and are dependent upon Aurora kinase B (AURKB). Late resistant cells are characterized by expansion of pre-existing NRAS mutant subclones and continued metabolic reprogramming. Our model closely mirrors the timing and mutations of AML patients treated with gilteritinib. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKB resensitizes both early resistant cell cultures and primary leukemia cells from gilteritinib-treated AML patients. These findings support a combinatorial strategy to target early resistant AML cells with AURKB inhibitors and gilteritinib before the expansion of pre-existing resistance mutations occurs.},

  abstract = {Heterosis has been widely used in agriculture, but the molecular mechanism for this remains largely elusive. In Arabidopsis hybrids and allopolyploids, increased photosynthetic and metabolic activities are linked to altered expression of circadian clock regulators, including CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1). It is unknown whether a similar mechanism mediates heterosis in maize hybrids. Here we report that higher levels of carbon fixation and starch accumulation in the maize hybrids are associated with altered temporal gene expression. Two maize CCA1 homologs, ZmCCA1a and ZmCCA1b, are diurnally up-regulated in the hybrids. Expressing ZmCCA1 complements the cca1 mutant phenotype in Arabidopsis, and overexpressing ZmCCA1b disrupts circadian rhythms and biomass heterosis. Furthermore, overexpressing ZmCCA1b in maize reduced chlorophyll content and plant height. Reduced height stems from reduced node elongation but not total node number in both greenhouse and field conditions. Phenotypes are less severe in the field than in the greenhouse, suggesting that enhanced light and/or metabolic activities in the field can compensate for altered circadian regulation in growth vigor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis reveals a temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding targets to the early morning in the hybrids, suggesting that activation of morning-phased genes in the hybrids promotes photosynthesis and growth vigor. This temporal shift of ZmCCA1-binding targets correlated with nonadditive and additive gene expression in early and late stages of seedling development. These results could guide breeding better hybrid crops to meet the growing demand in food and bioenergy.},

The enzyme is feedback-regulated by JA and thus a target of the JA-signalling pathway. A fusion genetic approach was used to isolate mutants in this signalling pathway. Seeds from transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing the Escherichia coli uidA gene encoding {$\beta$}-glucuronidase (GUS) under the control of the AOS promoter were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate and the progeny was screened for individuals exhibiting constitutive expression of uidA in the absence of an added octadecanoid. From 21,000 mutagenized plants, 8 lines showing constitutive AOS expression were obtained. The mutant lines were characterized further and fell into four classes, I to IV. All showed signs of growth inhibition encompassing both shoot and root systems, and accumulated higher than normal levels of OPDA. Mutants belonging to classes I and IV failed to set seeds due to defects in flower development which prevented self-pollination. One mutant, designated cas1, was characterized in more detail and showed, in addition to elevated levels of AOS mRNA, AOS polypeptide, OPDA, and JA, constitutive expression of JA-responsive genes (VSP2, PDF1.2). The cas1 mutation is recessive and affects a single locus. Using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) and simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLP), the mutated gene was mapped to chromosome IV next to the SSLP marker CIW7.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

Numerous studies have shown that plant pan-genomes are typically much larger than the genome of any individual and that a sizable fraction of the genes in any individual are present in only some genomes. The construction and interpretation of plant pan-genomes are challenging due to the large size and repetitive content of plant genomes. Most pan-genomes are largely focused on nontransposable element protein coding genes because they are more easily analyzed and defined than noncoding and repetitive sequences. Nevertheless, noncoding and repetitive DNA play important roles in determining the phenotype and genome evolution. Fortunately, it is now feasible to make multiple high-quality genomes that can be used to construct high-resolution pan-genomes that capture all the variation. However, assembling, displaying, and interacting with such high-resolution pan-genomes will require the development of new tools.},

Therefore, the breeding of salt-tolerant cultivars is necessary for the long-term sustainability of global corn production. Previous studies have shown that natural maize varieties display a large diversity of salt tolerance, yet the genetic variants underlying such diversity remain poorly discovered and applied, especially those mediating the tolerance to salt-induced osmotic stress (SIOS). Here we report a metabolomics-driven understanding and genetic improvement of maize SIOS tolerance. Using a LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach, we profiled the metabolomes of 266 maize inbred lines under control and salt conditions, and then identified 37 metabolite biomarkers of SIOS tolerance (METO1-37). Follow-up metabolic GWAS (mGWAS) and genotype-to-phenotype modeling identified 10 candidate genes significantly associating with the SIOS tolerance and METO abundances. Furthermore, we validated that a citrate synthase, a glucosyltransferase and a cytochrome P450 underlie the genotype-METO-SIOS tolerance associations, and showed that their favorable alleles additively improve the SIOS tolerance of elite maize inbred lines. Our study provides a novel insight into the natural variation of maize SIOS tolerance, which boosts the genetic improvement of maize salt tolerance, and demonstrates a metabolomics-based approach for mining crop genes associated with this complex agronomic trait.},

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified 28 genetic loci associated with fibre quality in allotetraploid cotton. To investigate the regulatory roles of these loci, we sequenced fibre transcriptomes of 251 cotton accessions and identified 15 330 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Analysis of local eQTL and GWAS data prioritised 13 likely causal genes for differential fibre quality in a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). Characterisation of distal eQTL revealed unequal genetic regulation patterns between two subgenomes, highlighted by an eQTL hotspot (Hot216) that established a genome-wide genetic network regulating the expression of 962 genes. The primary regulatory role of Hot216, and specifically the gene encoding a KIP-related protein, was found to be the transcriptional regulation of genes responsible for cell wall synthesis, which contributes to fibre length by modulating the developmental transition from rapid cell elongation to secondary cell wall synthesis. This study uncovered the genetic regulation of fibre-cell development and revealed the molecular basis of the temporal modulation of secondary cell wall synthesis during plant cell elongation.},

  abstract = {Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a major horticultural crop worldwide and has emerged as a preeminent model for metabolic research. Although many research efforts have focused on the analysis of metabolite differences between varieties and species, the dynamics of metabolic changes during the tomato growth cycle and the regulatory networks that underlie these changes are poorly understood. In this study, we integrated high-resolution spatio-temporal metabolome and transcriptome data to systematically explore the metabolic landscape across 20 major tomato tissues and growth stages. In the resulting MicroTom Metabolic Network, the 540 detected metabolites and their co-expressed genes could be divided into 10 distinct clusters based on their biological functions. Using this dataset, we constructed a global map of the major metabolic changes that occur throughout the tomato growth cycle and dissected the underlying regulatory network. In addition to verifying previously well-established regulatory networks for important metabolites, we identified novel transcription factors that regulate the biosynthesis of important secondary metabolites~such as steroidal glycoalkaloids and flavonoids. Our findings provide insights into spatio-temporal changes in tomato metabolism and generate a valuable resource for the study of metabolic regulatory processes in model plants.},

  abstract = {Heterosis or hybrid vigor is widespread in plants and animals. Although the molecular basis for heterosis has been extensively studied, metabolic and proteomic contributions to heterosis remain elusive. Here we report an integrative analysis of time-series metabolome and proteome data in maize (Zea mays) hybrids and their inbred parents. Many maize metabolites and proteins are diurnally regulated, and many of these show nonadditive abundance in the hybrids, including key enzymes and metabolites involved in carbon assimilation. Compared with robust trait heterosis, metabolic heterosis is relatively mild. Interestingly, most amino acids display negative mid-parent heterosis (MPH), i.e., having lower values than the average of the parents, while sugars, alcohols, and nucleoside metabolites show positive MPH. From the network perspective, metabolites in the photosynthetic pathway show positive MPH, whereas metabolites in the photorespiratory pathway show negative MPH, which corresponds to nonadditive protein abundance and enzyme activities of key enzymes in the respective pathways in the hybrids. Moreover, diurnally expressed proteins that are upregulated in the hybrids are enriched in photosynthesis-related gene-ontology terms. Hybrids may more effectively remove toxic metabolites generated during photorespiration, and thus maintain higher photosynthetic efficiency. These metabolic and proteomic resources provide unique insight into heterosis and its utilization for high yielding maize and other crop plants.},

In this study, we collected 548 sets of data of DM, HI, and grain yield from a multisite (40 sites) and multiyear (2009\textendash 2016) experiment conducted in major maize-growing regions across China and 615 sets of data from 40 published papers distributed from 1988 to 2018 to assess the performance of DM, HI, and their contributions to grain yield. It was found that the average contribution rate of DM was 73.71\%, which was much higher than those of HI (26.28\%) across China. For the five different modern hybrids, the contribution rates of DM to grain yield (ranged from 71.36\% to 89.10\%) were also significantly higher than those of HI (ranged from 10.79\% to 28.64\%) on a large spatial scale. The significant differences in grain yields between cultivars were mainly due to the differences in HI. Among the four maize-growing regions, the contribution rates of DM in both NW (57.34\%) and NM (64.46\%) were higher than those of HI (42.66\% and 35.54\%, respectively). In contrast, the contribution rates of HI in HM (52.67\%) and SW (50.92\%) were slightly higher than those of DM (47.33\% and 49.08\%, respectively). The interregional differences in grain yield were mainly attributed to the differences in DM between regions. Additionally, combining the data of this study and data collected from previous studies, we found that the increase in maize grain yield under lower yield levels ({$<$}15 Mg/ha) was mainly attributed to the increase in both DM and HI, while that under higher yield levels ({$>$}15 Mg/ha) was mainly dependent on the increase in DM.},

Owing to heterosis (hybrid vigor) in plants, these hybrids often have superior agricultural performances in yield or disease resistance succeeding their inbred parental lines. Several classical hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genetic causes of heterosis. During recent years, many new genetics and genomics strategies have been developed and used for the identifications of heterotic genes in plants. Heterotic effects of the heterotic loci and molecular functions of the heterotic genes are being investigated in many plants such as rice, maize, sorghum, Arabidopsis and tomato. More and more data and knowledge coming from the molecular studies of heterotic loci and genes will serve as a valuable resource for hybrid breeding by molecular design in future. This review aims to address recent advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of heterosis in plants.

In this study, we performed genome-wide analyses of AS responses to drought stress (DS), heat stress (HS) and their combination (HD) in wheat seedlings, and further compared them with transcriptional responses. In total, we found 200, 3576 and 4056 genes exhibiting significant AS pattern changes in response to DS, HS and HD, respectively, and combined drought and heat stress can induce specific AS compared with individual one. In addition, wheat homeologous genes exhibited differential AS responses under stress conditions that more AS events occurred on B subgenome than on A and D genomes. Comparison of genes regulated at AS and transcriptional levels showed that only 12\% of DS-induced AS genes were subjected to transcriptional regulation, whereas the proportion increased to 40\% under HS and HD. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that abiotic stress-responsive pathways tended to be highly overrepresented among these overlapped genes under HS and HD. Thus, we proposed that transcriptional regulation may play a major role in response to DS, which coordinates with AS regulation to contribute to HS and HD tolerance in wheat.},

  abstract = {Exogenous mechanical perturbations on living tissues are commonly used to investigate whether cell effectors can respond to mechanical cues. However, in most of these experiments, the applied mechanical stress and/or the biological response are described only qualitatively. We developed a quantitative pipeline based on microindentation and image analysis to investigate the impact of a controlled and prolonged compression on microtubule behaviour in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem, using microtubule fluorescent marker lines. We found that a compressive stress, in the order of magnitude of turgor pressure, induced apparent microtubule bundling. Importantly, that response could be reversed several hours after the release of compression. Next, we tested the contribution of microtubule severing to compression-induced bundling: microtubule bundling seemed less pronounced in the katanin mutant, in which microtubule severing is dramatically reduced. Conversely, some microtubule bundles could still be observed 16 h after the release of compression in the spiral2 mutant, in which severing rate is instead increased. To quantify the impact of mechanical stress on anisotropy and orientation of microtubule arrays, we used the nematic tensor based FibrilTool ImageJ/Fiji plugin. To assess the degree of apparent bundling of the network, we developed several methods, some of which were borrowed from geostatistics. The final microtubule bundling response could notably be related to tissue growth velocity that was recorded by the indenter during compression. Because both input and output are quantified, this pipeline is an initial step towards correlating more precisely the cytoskeleton response to mechanical stress in living tissues.},

Using machine-learning models we select 4.4 million accurately mapped tags as sequence anchors, 1.1 million of which are presence/absence variations. Structural variations exhibit enriched association with phenotypic traits, indicating that it is a significant source of adaptive variation in maize. The ability to efficiently map ultrahigh-density pan-genome sequence anchors enables fine characterization of structural variation and will advance both genetic research and breeding in many crops.},

However, repeatability is still an essential issue for the LC\textendash MS based methods, and convincing strategies for long time analysis are urgently required. Our former reported pseudotargeted method which combines nontargeted and targeted analyses, is proved to be a practical approach with high-quality and information-rich data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive strategy based on the pseudotargeted analysis by integrating blank-wash, pooled quality control (QC) sample, and post-calibration for the large-scale metabolomics study. The performance of strategy was optimized from both pre- and post-acquisition sections including the selection of QC samples, insertion frequency of QC samples, and post-calibration methods. These results imply that the pseudotargeted method is rather stable and suitable for large-scale study of metabolic profiling. As a proof of concept, the proposed strategy was applied to the combination of 3 independent batches within a time span of 5 weeks, and generated about 54\% of the features with coefficient of variations (CV) below 15\%. Moreover, the stability and maximal capability of a single analytical batch could be extended to at least 282 injections (about 110h) while still providing excellent stability, the CV of 63\% metabolic features was less than 15\%. Taken together, the improved repeatability of our strategy provides a reliable protocol for large-scale metabolomics studies.},

We documented that although the global abundance and distribution of m6A remained unchanged, a greater number of genes had gained an m6A modification in the hybrid. Superior variations were observed at the m6A modification and translational efficiency levels when compared with mRNA abundance between the hybrid and parents. In the hybrid, the vast majority of genes with m6A modification exhibited a non-additive expression pattern, the percentage of which was much higher than that at levels of mRNA abundance and translational efficiency. Non-additive genes involved in different biological processes were hierarchically coordinated by discrete combinations of three regulatory layers. These findings suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression make distinct contributions to heterosis in hybrid maize. Overall, this integrated multi-omics analysis provides a valuable portfolio for interpreting transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in hybrid maize, and paves the way for exploring molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid vigor.},

  abstract = {Heterosis and increasing planting density have contributed to improving maize grain yield (GY) for several decades. As planting densities increase, the GY per plot also increases, whereas the contribution of heterosis to GY decreases. There are trade-offs between heterosis and planting density, and the transcriptional characterization of heterosis may explain the mechanism involved. In this study, 48 transcriptome libraries were sequenced from four inbred Chinese maize lines and their F1 hybrids. They were planted at densities of 45000 and 67500 plants ha-1. Maternal-effect differentially expressed genes (DEGs) played important roles in processes related to photosynthesis and carbohydrate biosynthesis and metabolism. Paternal-effect DEGs participated in abiotic/biotic stress response and plant hormone production under high planting density. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed that high planting density induced heterosis-related genes regulating abiotic/biotic stress response, plant hormone biosynthesis, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, but repressed other genes regulating energy formation. Under high planting density, maternal genes were mainly enriched in the photosynthesis reaction center, while paternal genes were mostly concentrated in the peripheral antenna system. Four important genes were identified in maize heterosis and high planting density, all with functions in photosynthesis, starch biosynthesis, auxin metabolism, gene silencing, and RNAi.},

An MS2T library of Arabidopsis metabolites was created from a set of MS/MS spectra acquired using the automatic data acquisition function of the mass spectrometer. By using this library, we obtained structural information for the detected peaks in the metabolic profile data without performing additional MS/MS analysis; this was achieved by searching for the corresponding MS2T accession in the library. In the case of metabolic profile data for Arabidopsis tissues containing more than 1000 peaks, approximately 50\% of the peaks were tagged by MS2Ts, and 90 peaks were identified or tentatively annotated with metabolite information by searching the metabolite databases and manually interpreting the MS2Ts. A comparison of metabolic profiles among the Arabidopsis tissues revealed that many unknown metabolites accumulated in a tissue-specific manner, some of which were deduced to be unusual Arabidopsis metabolites based on the MS2T data. Candidate genes responsible for these biosyntheses could be predicted by projecting the results to the transcriptome data. The method was also used for metabolic phenotyping of a subset of Ds transposon-inserted lines of Arabidopsis, resulting in clarification of the functions of reported genes involved in glycosylation of flavonoids. Thus, non-targeted metabolic profiling analysis using MS2T annotation methods could prove to be useful for investigating novel functions of secondary metabolites in plants.},

  abstract = {Forty years ago, 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) was reported as a prostaglandin (PG)-like metabolite of linolenic acid found in extracts of flaxseed. Since then, numerous studies have determined the role of 12-OPDA in regulating plant immunity, seed dormancy, and germination. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the regulation of 12-OPDA synthesis in the chloroplast and 12-OPDA-dependent signaling in gene expression and targeting protein functions. We describe the properties of OPDA that are linked to the activities of PGs, which are derived from arachidonic acid and act as tissue hormones in animals, including humans. The similarity of OPDA with bioactive PGs is particularly evident for the most-studied cyclopentenone, PG 15-dPGJ2. In addition to chemical approaches towards 12-OPDA synthesis, bio-organic synthesis strategies for 12-OPDA and analogous substances have recently been established. The resulting availability of OPDA will aid the identification of additional effector proteins, help in elucidating the mechanisms of OPDA sensing and transmission, and will foster the analysis of the physiological responses to OPDA in plants. There is a need to determine the compartmentation and transport of 12-OPDA and its conjugates, over long distances as well as short. It will be important to further study OPDA in animal and human cells, for example with respect to beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize stover is an important source of crop residues and a promising sustainable energy source in the United States. Stalk is the main component of stover, representing about half of stover dry weight. Characterization of genetic determinants of stalk traits provide a foundation to optimize maize stover as a biofuel feedstock. We investigated maize natural genetic variation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to detect candidate genes associated with traits related to stalk biomass (stalk diameter and plant height) and stalk anatomy (rind thickness, vascular bundle density and area). RESULTS: Using a panel of 942 diverse inbred lines, 899,784 RNA-Seq derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified. Stalk traits were measured on 800 members of the panel in replicated field trials across years. GWAS revealed 16 candidate genes associated with four stalk traits. Most of the detected candidate genes were involved in fundamental cellular functions, such as regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression. Two of the regulatory genes (Zmm22 and an ortholog of Fpa) that were associated with plant height were previously shown to be involved in regulating the vegetative to floral transition. The association of Zmm22 with plant height was confirmed using a transgenic approach. Transgenic lines with increased expression of Zmm22 showed a significant decrease in plant height as well as tassel branch number, indicating a pleiotropic effect of Zmm22. CONCLUSION: Substantial heritable variation was observed in the association panel for stalk traits, indicating a large potential for improving useful stalk traits in breeding programs. Genome-wide association analyses detected several candidate genes associated with multiple traits, suggesting common regulatory elements underlie various stalk traits. Results of this study provide insights into the genetic control of maize stalk anatomy and biomass.},

  abstract = {Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) efficiently synthesizes the antifungal phytoalexin camalexin without the apparent release of bioactive intermediates, such as indole-3-acetaldoxime, suggesting that the biosynthetic pathway of this compound is channeled by the formation of an enzyme complex. To identify such protein interactions, we used two independent untargeted coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) approaches with the biosynthetic enzymes CYP71B15 and CYP71A13 as baits and determined that the camalexin biosynthetic P450 enzymes copurified with these enzymes. These interactions were confirmed by targeted co-IP and F\"orster resonance energy transfer measurements based on fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FRET-FLIM). Furthermore, the interaction of CYP71A13 and Arabidopsis P450 Reductase1 was observed. We detected increased substrate affinity of CYP79B2 in the presence of CYP71A13, indicating an allosteric interaction. Camalexin biosynthesis involves glutathionylation of the intermediary indole-3-cyanohydrin, which is synthesized by CYP71A12 and especially CYP71A13. FRET-FLIM and co-IP demonstrated that the glutathione transferase GSTU4, which is coexpressed with Trp- and camalexin-specific enzymes, is physically recruited to the complex. Surprisingly, camalexin concentrations were elevated in knockout and reduced in GSTU4-overexpressing plants. This shows that GSTU4 is not directly involved in camalexin biosynthesis but rather plays a role in a competing mechanism.},

Our primary goal in this chapter is to provide a general guide to strategies for the effective use of the data and materials in these collections. To do this, we provide a general introduction to the T-DNA insertional sequence-indexed mutant collections with a focus on how best to use the available data sources for good line selection. As isolation of a homozygous line is a common next step once a potential disruption line has been identified, the second half of the chapter provides a step-by-step guide for the design and implementation of a T-DNA genotyping pipeline. Finally, we describe interpretation of genotyping results and include a troubleshooting section for common types of segregation distortions that we have observed. In this chapter we introduce both basic concepts and specific applications to both new and more experienced users of the collections for the design and implementation of small- to large-scale genotyping pipelines.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases rank first in mortality worldwide. Platelets have been considered the main cardiovascular risk factor since they play an important role, in atherosclerosis and the development of acute thrombotic events. The hyperactivation of platelets leads to platelet aggregation and the formation of clogs, blocking the passage of blood to the different organs and tissues. Blood obstruction contributes to blood vessel stenosis, ischemia, and heart attack. At present, it is vital to find new targets for the development of safer and more effective antiplatelet agents. A diet rich in bioactive compounds can help in the prevention of cardiovascular events since it has been shown that some of these metabolites can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic disease by inhibiting platelet aggregation. This review aims to collect and discuss the largest amount of information reported updated on the cardioprotective and antiplatelet activities of the different bioactive compounds extracted from natural products. The compounds were divided into different groups (phenolic acids, flavonoids, carotenoids (lycopene and B-carotenes), and sulfides. Myricetin, a natural flavonoid present in berries, nuts, and green tea, is well-known for its anticancer properties. Even though several previous studies have reported the anticancer effects induced by myricetin, these effects have not yet been confirmed in the adenocarcinoma gastric cell line (AGS). Moreover, the exact mechanisms of myricetin-induced apoptosis and autophagy have not been clearly identified either. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the role of myricetin in inducing apoptosis and autophagy in AGS gastric cancer cells. First, the survival rate of AGS gastric cancer cells was assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Thereafter, the rate of apoptosis was analyzed using4{${'}$},6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining as well as annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, and the expression of the proteins associated with apoptosis, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and autophagy was examined by western blotting. We observed that myricetin reduced the survival rate of AGS gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby inducing apoptosis and autophagy. Similar results were also obtained in vivo, and tumor growth was inhibited. Therefore, in the AGS gastric cancer cells, myricetin seems to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which in turn leads to apoptosis in vitroand in vivo, cell-protective autophagy, as well as inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. These results indicate the potential of myricetin as a natural anticancer agent. The rapid transmission of the pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged as an entire worldwide health concern and it was declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a consequence of the increasing reported infections number. COVID-19 disease is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and unfortunatly no drugs are currently approved against this desease. Accordingly, it is of outmost importance to review the possible therapeutic effects of naturally-occuring compounds that showed approved antiviral activities. The molecular docking approach offers a rapid prediction of a possible inhibition of the main enzymes Mpro and RdRp that play crucial role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. In the present work, we review the anti-viral activities of polyphenol compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids and stilbene) derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal Vitis amurensis. Recent molecular docking studies reported the possible binding of these polyphenols on SARS-CoV-2 enzymes Mpro and RdRp active sites and showed interesting inhibitory effects. This antiviral activity was explained by the structure-activity relationships of the studied compounds. Also, pharmacokinetic analysis of the studied molecules is simulated in the present work. Among the studied polyphenol compounds, only five, namely caffeic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, naringenin and catechin have drug-likeness characteristics. These five polyphenols derived from Vitis amurensis are promising drug candidates for the COVID-19 treatment. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the in vitro anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties of four underutilized ethno-medicinal plants viz. Apluda mutica, Mikania micrantha, Kyllinga nemoralis and Cleome rutidosperma, growing in different parts of West Bengal, India. The anti-oxidant properties were evaluated using four different solvent extracts. The 70\% aq. ethanol extract of investigated plant samples were found to have adequate quantities of total phenolic (141.94{$\pm$}0.67-230.45{$\pm$}0.12 mg GAE/g dry extract), total flavonoid (23.27{$\pm$}0.04-71.05 {$\pm$}0.06 mg RE/ g dry extract) and anti-oxidant capacities documented by DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, reducing power, anti-lipid peroxidation and metal chelating activities. The 70\% aq. ethanol extracts of the plants showed most promising antioxidant activity and were investigated for phenolics quantification by HPLC, anti-diabetic properties by assessing {$\alpha$}-amylase, {$\alpha$}-glucosidase inhibitory activities and anti-inflammatory capabilities by protein denaturation inhibition. HPLC studies revealed the presence of several phenolic acids and flavonoids in variable levels. M. micrantha exhibited {$\alpha$}- amylase inhibition (IC50=58.44 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL), which was comparable to that of standard acarbose (IC50 = 53.80 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL). The maximum inhibition of protein denaturation was observed in M. micrantha (IC50=89.27 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL) followed by K. nemoralis (IC50 = 98.78 {$\pm$} 0.01 \textmu g/mL). The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clear separation among the wild plants under investigation. The outcomes demonstrate that these plants were shown to contain a remarkable amount of different bioactive compounds, hence affirming their contribution in several biological activities and to serve as a potential anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic agent in food and pharmaceutical industries. Myricetin (MYR) shows a lot of pharmacological activity such as antioxidant capacity and antitumor activity. However, the poor aqueous solubility of MYR (2 {$\mu$}g/mL) limits its pharmaceutical applications. To improve the dissolution rate of MYR, microparticles and inclusion complexes of MYR were successfully prepared by supercritical antisolvent (SAS) technology. The effects of the drug concentration, temperature, pressure, CO2 and solution volumetric feeding rate on the formation of MYR microparticles and the MYR/hydroxypropyl-{$\beta$}-cyclodextrin (HP-{$\beta$}-CD) complex microparticles were investigated systematically. The physical and chemical properties of the MYR microparticles were characterized by SEM, DSC, FTIR and XRD. After SAS processed, the particle size of MYR microparticles decreased and the crystal form of MYR changed due to the complexation with HP-{$\beta$}-CD, which lead to enhanced solubility, dissolution rate and further improve the antioxidant activity and antitumor activity. Bryophyllum constitutes a subgenus within the genus Kalanchoe that contains several plant species used in traditional medicine worldwide for the treatment of several diseases. However, little is known about the phytoconstituents of Bryophyllum spp. and previous reports have pointed at their low in Planta concentrations of bioactive compounds. In this work, we take advantage of plant in vitro culture for the study of the phenolic compounds found in the aerial parts of Bryophyllum spp. and their associated bioactivities. Our results show that the induction of nutritional stress leads to an improved accumulation of phenolic compounds, mainly flavonols and anthocyanins, represented by myricetin and malvidin glycosides, respectively. This effect is mainly found for B. \texttimes{} houghtonii, whose hydroethanolic extracts promoted the highest antioxidant, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities. In the case of cytotoxic activity, Bryophyllum extracts showed an enhanced activity against the MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line. Meanwhile, extracts from B. daigremontianum promoted a wide range of effectiveness against different bacterial and fungal strains. This study is committed to shed light about the phytochemical potential associated to this unexplored subgenus, with the aim of considering Bryophyllum spp. as a valuable source of bioactive compounds for their exploitation in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.},

However, our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms behind ABA-mediated drought tolerance in pomegranates is still limited. In this study, we treated the pomegranates under drought stress with exogenous ABA of different concentrations (30, 60 and 90~{$\mu$}M) and found that, compared to those without treatment, ABA can improve pomegranate's growth condition and related physiological responding processes. We also performed comparative transcriptome analysis between the ABA-treated and untreated pomegranates to reveal the ABA-induced mechanisms in response to drought-stress. Our results showed that exogenous ABA application substantially enhanced pomegranate drought resistance by strengthening some metabolic pathways, such as brassinosteroid synthesis, peroxisome biogenesis, photosynthesis and hemicelluloses synthesis. Furthermore, the over-dose treatment of exogenous ABA was found to trigger ABA degradation process and a feedback loop in pomegranate to balances the ABA accumulation that exceeds the optimal ABA requirement, at the cost of suppressed growth process and stress resistance. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular regulation mechanisms underlying the ABA-mediated drought-stress resistance in pomegranates.},

  abstract = {The plant hormone auxin, a master coordinator of development, regulates hypocotyl elongation during seedling growth. We previously identified the synthetic molecule RubNeddin 1 (RN1), which induces degradation of the AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID-INDUCIBLE3 (IAA3) and IAA7 in planta and strongly promotes hypocotyl elongation. In the present study, we show that despite the structural similarity of RN1 to the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic-acid (2,4-D), direct treatments with these compounds in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) result in distinct effects, possibly due to enhanced uptake of RN1 and low-level, chronic release of 2,4-D from RN1 in planta. We confirm RN1-induced hypocotyl elongation occurs via specific TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT1 (TIR1)/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) receptor-mediated auxin signaling involving TIR1, AFB2, and AFB5. Using a transcriptome profiling strategy and candidate gene approach, we identify the genes ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA10 (ZAT10), ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA31 (ATL31), and WRKY DNA-BINDING PROTEIN33 (WRKY33) as being rapidly upregulated by RN1, despite being downregulated by 2,4-D treatment. RN1-induced expression of these genes also occurs via TIR1/AFB-mediated auxin signaling. Our results suggest both hypocotyl elongation and transcription of these genes are induced by RN1 via the promoted degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressor IAA7. Moreover, these three genes, which are known to be stress-related, act in an inter-dependent transcriptional regulatory network controlling hypocotyl elongation. Together, our results suggest ZAT10, ATL31, and WRKY33 take part in a common gene network regulating hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis downstream of a selective auxin perception module likely involving TIR1, AFB2, and AFB5 and inducing the degradation of IAA7.},

A way to preserve phenotypic and genetic diversity is to re-evaluate traditional landraces to introduce their benefits to the broader public. Common onion genotypes vary greatly in their storability. In particular, temperature and relative humidity during storage have significant impact on the metabolites in onions after storage. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the metabolite profile of ten onion genotypes after five months of cold storage. In addition, a characterization of onion landraces in their fresh state was also conducted in order to compare their properties against a commercial genotype. Onion genotypes were grown under organic farming conditions. After harvest and curing, bulbs were stored for up to 22 weeks. Before and after storage, bulb samples were analyzed through targeted and untargeted methods. Out of 189 identified metabolites, 128 showed a storage effect. Mainly fructans decreased because of respiration and energy demand, while monosaccharides increased. Further, amino acids were altered in their concentration after storage with an effect on aroma precursors. Eight of the nine landraces had good storability without critical losses. In their fresh state, the onion genotypes clustered into three major groups. For instance, landraces of group III showed consistently and substantially higher levels of amino acids and certain sugars, indicating a high potential of aromatic properties in those onion landraces.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics is an 'omics' approach that aims to analyze all metabolites in a biological sample comprehensively. The detailed metabolite profiling of thousands of plant samples has great potential for directly elucidating plant metabolic processes. However, both a comprehensive analysis and a high throughput are difficult to achieve at the same time due to the wide diversity of metabolites in plants. Here, we have established a novel and practical metabolomics methodology for quantifying hundreds of targeted metabolites in a high-throughput manner. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQMS), which monitors both the specific precursor ions and product ions of each metabolite, is a standard technique in targeted metabolomics, as it enables high sensitivity, reproducibility and a broad dynamic range. In this study, we optimized the MRM conditions for specific compounds by performing automated flow injection analyses with TQMS. Based on a total of 61,920 spectra for 860 authentic compounds, the MRM conditions of 497 compounds were successfully optimized. These were applied to high-throughput automated analysis of biological samples using TQMS coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). By this analysis, approximately 100 metabolites were quantified in each of 14 plant accessions from Brassicaceae, Gramineae and Fabaceae. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the metabolite accumulation patterns clearly showed differences among the plant families, and family-specific metabolites could be predicted using a batch-learning self-organizing map analysis. Thus, the automated widely targeted metabolomics approach established here should pave the way for large-scale metabolite profiling and comparative metabolomics.},

Upstream biological disruptions result in a series of metabolomic changes and, as such, the metabolome holds a wealth of information that is thought to be most predictive of phenotype. Uncovering this knowledge is a work in progress. The field of metabolomics is still maturing; the community has leveraged proteomics experience when applicable and developed a range of sample preparation and instrument methodology along with myriad data processing and analysis approaches. Research focuses have now shifted toward a fundamental understanding of the biology responsible for metabolomic changes. There are several types of metabolomics experiments including both targeted and untargeted analyses. While untargeted, hypothesis generating workflows exhibit many valuable attributes, challenges inherent to the approach remain. This Critical Insight comments on these challenges, focusing on the identification process of LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics studies-specifically in mammalian systems. Biological interpretation of metabolomics data hinges on the ability to accurately identify metabolites. The range of confidence associated with identifications that is often overlooked is reviewed, and opportunities for advancing the metabolomics field are described. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.},

Here, we develop a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis. Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples, we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000 metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment. Our results demonstrate that MetDNA substantially expands metabolite annotation, enabling quantitative assessment of metabolic pathways and facilitating integrative multi-omics analysis.},

Here, utilizing a high-density genetic map, we conducted a comprehensive metabolome study via widely targeted LC-MS/MS to analyze the wheat kernel metabolism. We further combined agronomic traits and dissected the genetic relationship between metabolites and agronomic traits. In total, 1260 metabolic features were detected. Using linkage analysis, 1005 metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) were found distributed unevenly across the genome. Twenty-four candidate genes were found to modulate the levels of different metabolites, of which two were functionally annotated by in vitro analysis to be involved in the synthesis and modification of flavonoids. Combining the correlation analysis of metabolite-agronomic traits with the co-localization of methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) and phenotypic QTL (pQTL), genetic relationships between the metabolites and agronomic traits were uncovered. For example, a candidate was identified using correlation and co-localization analysis that may manage auxin accumulation, thereby affecting number of grains per spike (NGPS). Furthermore, metabolomics data were used to predict the performance of wheat agronomic traits, with metabolites being found that provide strong predictive power for NGPS and plant height. This study used metabolomics and association analysis to better understand the genetic basis of the wheat metabolism which will ultimately assist in wheat breeding.},

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) seeds are a good source of protein, despite being deficient in several essential amino acids. However, eliminating the highly abundant but poorly balanced seed storage proteins has revealed that the regulation of seed amino acids is complex and does not rely on only a handful of proteins. In this study, we used two complementary omics-based approaches to shed light on the genes and biological processes that underlie the regulation of seed amino acid composition. We first conducted a genome-wide association study to identify candidate genes involved in the natural variation of seed protein-bound amino acids. We then used weighted gene correlation network analysis to associate protein expression with seed amino acid composition dynamics during kernel development and maturation. We found that almost half of the proteome was significantly reduced during kernel development and maturation, including several translational machinery components such as ribosomal proteins, which strongly suggests translational reprogramming. The reduction was significantly associated with a decrease in several amino acids, including lysine and methionine, pointing to their role in shaping the seed amino acid composition. When we compared the candidate gene lists generated from both approaches, we found a nonrandom overlap of 80 genes. A functional analysis of these genes showed a tight interconnected cluster dominated by translational machinery genes, especially ribosomal proteins, further supporting the role of translation dynamics in shaping seed amino acid composition. These findings strongly suggest that seed biofortification strategies that target the translation machinery dynamics should be considered and explored further.},

  abstract = {Thousands of species will be sequenced in the next few years; however, understanding how their genomes work, without an unlimited budget, requires both molecular and novel evolutionary approaches. We developed a sensitive sequence alignment pipeline to identify conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) in the Andropogoneae tribe (multiple crop species descended from a common ancestor {$\sim$}18 million years ago). The Andropogoneae share similar physiology while being tremendously genomically diverse, harboring a broad range of ploidy levels, structural variation, and transposons. These contribute to the potential of Andropogoneae as a powerful system for studying CNSs and are factors we leverage to understand the function of maize CNSs. We found that 86\% of CNSs were comprised of annotated features, including introns, UTRs, putative cis-regulatory elements, chromatin loop anchors, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and several transposable element superfamilies. CNSs were enriched in active regions of DNA replication in the early S phase of the mitotic cell cycle and showed different DNA methylation ratios compared to the genome-wide background. More than half of putative cis-regulatory sequences (identified via other methods) overlapped with CNSs detected in this study. Variants in CNSs were associated with gene expression levels, and CNS absence contributed to loss of gene expression. Furthermore, the evolution of CNSs was associated with the functional diversification of duplicated genes in the context of maize subgenomes. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the molecular processes governing the evolution of CNSs in maize.},

This review comprehensively retrieved and collected the latest pharmacological abstracts on MYR, and discussed the potential molecular mechanisms of its effects. The results of our review indicated that MYR has a therapeutic effect on many diseases, including tumors of different types, inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, cerebral ischemia, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and pathogenic microbial infections. Furthermore, it regulates the expression of Hippo, MAPK, GSK-3{$\beta$}, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, STAT3, TLR, I{$\kappa$}B/NF-{$\kappa$}B, Nrf2/HO-1, ACE, eNOS / NO, AChE and BrdU/NeuN. MYR also enhances the immunomodulatory functions, suppresses cytokine storms, improves cardiac dysfunction, possesses an antiviral potential, can be used as an adjuvant treatment against cancer, cardiovascular injury and nervous system diseases, and it may be a potential drug against COVID-19 and other viral infections.

The ability of the enzyme to liberate sinapic acid from the donor molecule 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose indicates the existence of a short-lived acylenzyme intermediate in the proposed random sequential bi-bi mechanism of catalysis. SMT-catalyzed formation of disinapoylglucose has been corroborated by docking studies with an established homology structure model that illustrates the possible binding of two 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose molecules in the active site and the intermolecular reaction of the two glucose esters. The SMT gene is embedded in a tandem cluster of five SCPL sinapoyltransferase genes, which encode enzymes with high amino acid sequence identities and partially overlapping substrate specificities. We assume that in recent duplications of genes encoding SCPL proteins, neofunctionalization of the duplicates to accept 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-glucose as acyl donor was gained first, followed by subfunctionalization leading to different acyl acceptor specificities.},

  abstract = {Plant shoots elaborate their adult form by selective control over the growth of both their primary shoot apical meristem and their axillary shoot meristems. We describe recessive mutations at two loci in Arabidopsis, MAX1 and MAX2, that affect the selective repression of axillary shoots. All the first order (but not higher order) axillary shoots initiated by mutant plants remain active, resulting in bushier shoots than those of wild type. In vegetative plants where axillary shoots develop in a basal to apical sequence, the mutations do not clearly alter node distance, from the shoot apex, at which axillary shoot meristems initiate but shorten the distance at which the first axillary leaf primordium is produced by the axillary shoot meristem. A small number of mutant axillary shoot meristems is enlarged and, later in development, a low proportion of mutant lateral shoots is fasciated. Together, this suggests that MAX1 and MAX2 do not control the timing of axillary meristem initiation but repress primordia formation by the axillary meristem. In addition to shoot branching, mutations at both loci affect leaf shape. The mutations at MAX2 cause increased hypocotyl and petiole elongation in light-grown seedlings. Positional cloning identifies MAX2 as a member of the F-box leucine-rich repeat family of proteins. MAX2 is identical to ORE9, a proposed regulator of leaf senescence ( Woo, H. R., Chung, K. M., Park, J.-H., Oh, S. A., Ahn, T., Hong, S. H., Jang, S. K. and Nam, H. G. (2001) Plant Cell 13, 1779-1790).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrid progeny relative to the parental phenotypes. Maize exhibits heterosis for a wide range of traits, however the magnitude of heterosis is highly variable depending on the choice of parents and the trait(s) measured. We have used expression profiling to determine whether the level, or types, of non-additive gene expression vary in maize hybrids with different levels of genetic diversity or heterosis. RESULTS: We observed that the distributions of better parent heterosis among a series of 25 maize hybrids generally do not exhibit significant correlations between different traits. Expression profiling analyses for six of these hybrids, chosen to represent diversity in genotypes and heterosis responses, revealed a correlation between genetic diversity and transcriptional variation. The majority of differentially expressed genes in each of the six different hybrids exhibited additive expression patterns, and approximately 25\% exhibited statistically significant non-additive expression profiles. Among the non-additive profiles, approximately 80\% exhibited hybrid expression levels between the parental levels, approximately 20\% exhibited hybrid expression levels at the parental levels and \textasciitilde 1\% exhibited hybrid levels outside the parental range. CONCLUSION: We have found that maize inbred genetic diversity is correlated with transcriptional variation. However, sampling of seedling tissues indicated that the frequencies of additive and non-additive expression patterns are very similar across a range of hybrid lines. These findings suggest that heterosis is probably not a consequence of higher levels of additive or non-additive expression, but may be related to transcriptional variation between parents. The lack of correlation between better parent heterosis levels for different traits suggests that transcriptional diversity at specific sets of genes may influence heterosis for different traits.},

The engineered trait is robust as it improves yield in an inbred as well as in a panel of hybrids, at several locations and over multiple seasons in the field. Transcriptome studies, hormone measurements and the expression of the auxin responsive DR5rev:mRFPer marker suggest that PLA1 may function through an increase in auxin. Detailed analysis of growth over time demonstrates that PLA1 stimulates the duration of leaf elongation by maintaining dividing cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state for a longer period of time. The prolonged duration of growth also compensates for growth rate reduction caused by abiotic stresses.},

Removal of platform-specific sources of variability such as systematic error is therefore one of the foremost priorities in data preprocessing. However, chemical diversity of molecular species included in typical metabolic profiling experiments leads to different responses to variations in experimental conditions, making normalization a very demanding task. RESULTS: With the aim to remove unwanted systematic variation, we present an approach that utilizes variability information from multiple internal standard compounds to find optimal normalization factor for each individual molecular species detected by metabolomics approach (NOMIS). We demonstrate the method on mouse liver lipidomic profiles using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, and compare its performance to two commonly utilized normalization methods: normalization by l2 norm and by retention time region specific standard compound profiles. The NOMIS method proved superior in its ability to reduce the effect of systematic error across the full spectrum of metabolite peaks. We also demonstrate that the method can be used to select best combinations of standard compounds for normalization. CONCLUSION: Depending on experiment design and biological matrix, the NOMIS method is applicable either as a one-step normalization method or as a two-step method where the normalization parameters, influenced by variabilities of internal standard compounds and their correlation to metabolites, are first calculated from a study conducted in repeatability conditions. The method can also be used in analytical development of metabolomics methods by helping to select best combinations of standard compounds for a particular biological matrix and analytical platform.},

In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the field of plant pan-genomes.

Advances in diploid hybrid breeding based on true seeds have the potential to revolutionize future potato breeding and production1\textendash 4. So far, relatively few studies have examined the genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated landrace potatoes, which limits the application of their diversity in potato breeding. Here we assemble 44 high-quality diploid potato genomes from 24 wild and 20 cultivated accessions that are representative of Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade, as well as 2 genomes from the neighbouring section, Etuberosum. Extensive discordance of phylogenomic relationships suggests the complexity of potato evolution. We find that the potato genome substantially expanded its repertoire of disease-resistance genes when compared with closely related seed-propagated solanaceous crops, indicative of the effect of tuber-based propagation strategies on the evolution of the potato genome. We discover a transcription factor that determines tuber identity and interacts with the mobile tuberization inductive signal SP6A. We also identify 561,433 high-confidence structural variants and construct a map of large inversions, which provides insights for improving inbred lines and precluding potential linkage drag, as exemplified by a 5.8-Mb inversion that is associated with carotenoid content in tubers. This study will accelerate hybrid potato breeding and enrich our understanding of the evolution and biology of potato as a global staple food crop.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sweet tea, which functions as tea, sugar and medicine, was listed as a new food resource in 2017. Flavonoids are the main medicinal components in sweet tea and have significant pharmacological activities. Therefore, the quality of sweet tea is related to the content of flavonoids. Flavonoid content in plants is normally determined by time-consuming and expensive chemical analyses. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology to measure three constituents of flavonoids, namely, total flavonoids, phloridin and trilobatin, in sweet tea leaves using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR). RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and NIR spectroscopy can distinguish sweet tea from different locations. In addition, different spectral preprocessing methods are used to establish partial least squares (PLS) models between spectral information and the content of the three constituents. The best total flavonoid prediction model was obtained with NIR spectra preprocessed with Savitzky-Golay combined with second derivatives (SG\,+\,D2) (RP2\,=\,0.893, and RMSEP\,=\,0.131). For trilobatin, the model with the best performance was developed with raw NIR spectra (RP2\,=\,0.902, and RMSEP\,=\,2.993), and for phloridin, the best model was obtained with NIR spectra preprocessed with standard normal variate (SNV) (RP2\,=\,0.818, and RMSEP\,=\,1.085). The coefficients of determination for all calibration sets, validation sets and prediction sets of the best PLS models were higher than 0.967, 0.858 and 0.818, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion indicated that NIR spectroscopy has the ability to determine the flavonoid content of sweet tea quickly and conveniently.},

To understand and ultimately correct this deficiency, we quantified flavor-associated chemicals in 398 modern, heirloom, and wild accessions. A subset of these accessions was evaluated in consumer panels, identifying the chemicals that made the most important contributions to flavor and consumer liking. We found that modern commercial varieties contain significantly lower amounts of many of these important flavor chemicals than older varieties. Whole-genome sequencing and a genome-wide association study permitted identification of genetic loci that affect most of the target flavor chemicals, including sugars, acids, and volatiles. Together, these results provide an understanding of the flavor deficiencies in modern commercial varieties and the information necessary for the recovery of good flavor through molecular breeding.},

The results showed that the concentration of antioxidants in red raspberry puree was reduced with the addition of pectin. Similarly, addition of pectin to red raspberry puree significantly reduced the total phenolic content (15\textendash 20\%), total antioxidant capacity (18\textendash 70\%), and total monomeric anthocyanin (25\textendash 30\%) after in vitro digestion. On the other hand, significant decreases in the bioaccessible amount of cyanidin (41\%), cyanidin-3-glucoside (14\%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (17\%), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (16\%), and peonidin (28\%) were observed after the addition of pectin (5\% (w/w)) compared to the control (p~{$<~$}0.05) as analyzed with the HPLC method. According to the LC-MS/MS analysis of red raspberry samples, five flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and phlorizin) and six phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid) were detected. The effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion varied depending on the type of the phenolic compounds. Sinapic acid and phlorizin were not detected at all in the intestinal phase, indicating that they were completely degraded during digestion. The percentage bioaccessibility of gallic acid (49\textendash 88\%), rutin (6\textendash 16\%), and quercetin (23\textendash 33\%) was decreased proportionally with the increase in the pectin content in red raspberry purees (p~{$<~$}0.05). On the other hand, only 5\% pectin addition to red raspberry puree resulted with a significant decrease in the amount of bioaccessible caffeic acid (8\% to 5\%), kaempferol (24\% to 13\%), ferulic acid (26\% to 10\%), and myricetin (91\% to 57\%) (p~{$<~$}0.05). Overall, the present study highlighted that incorporation of pectin to red raspberry puree reduced the amount of bioaccessible polyphenols.},

The strategy became increasingly popular for the simultaneous analysis of up to several hundred metabolites at high sensitivity, selectivity, and quantitative capability. However, the traditional method of assessing measured metabolomics data without probabilistic criteria is not only time-consuming but is often subjective and makeshift work. Our program overcomes these problems by detecting and identifying metabolites automatically, by separating isomeric metabolites, and by removing background noise using a probabilistic score defined as the odds ratio from an optimized multivariate logistic regression model. Our software program also provides a user-friendly graphical interface to curate and organize data matrices and to apply principal component analyses and statistical tests. For a demonstration, we conducted a widely targeted metabolome analysis (152 metabolites) of propagating Saccharomyces cerevisiae measured at 15 time points by gas and liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. MRMPROBS is a useful and practical tool for the assessment of large-scale MRM data available to any instrument or any experimental condition.},

The method exploits the structure of available data and matrix dissection for minimal data loss, without data imputation. This strategy implements two common batch effect reduction methods\textemdash ComBat and limma (removeBatchEffect()). The HarmonizR strategy, evaluated on four exemplarily analyzed datasets with up to 23 batches, demonstrated successful data harmonization for different tissue preservation techniques, LC-MS/MS instrumentation setups, and quantification approaches. Compared to data imputation methods, HarmonizR was more efficient and performed superior regarding the detection of significant proteins. HarmonizR is an efficient tool for missing data tolerant experimental variance reduction and is easily adjustable for individual dataset properties and user preferences.},

This influence of host genotype on microbiome composition has been demonstrated in many systems; however, most previous studies have either compared unrelated genotypes or delved into molecular mechanisms. As a result, it is currently unclear whether the heritability of host-associated microbiomes follows similar patterns to the heritability of other complex traits. We take a new approach to this question by comparing the microbiomes of diverse maize inbred lines and their F1 hybrid offspring, which we quantified in both rhizosphere and leaves of field-grown plants using 16S-v4 and ITS1 amplicon sequencing. We show that inbred lines and hybrids differ consistently in the composition of bacterial and fungal rhizosphere communities, as well as leaf-associated fungal communities. A wide range of microbiome features display heterosis within individual crosses, consistent with patterns for nonmicrobial maize phenotypes. For leaf microbiomes, these results were supported by the observation that broad-sense heritability in hybrids was substantially higher than narrow-sense heritability. Our results support our hypothesis that at least some heterotic host traits affect microbiome composition in maize.},

Herein, we identified a total of 226 full-length F-box genes in pear for the first time. And these genes were further divided into various subgroups based on specific domains and phylogenetic analysis. Intriguingly, we observed that whole-genome duplication and dispersed duplication have a major contribution to F-box family expansion. Furthermore, the dynamic evolution for different modes of gene duplication was dissected. Interestingly, we found that dispersed and tandem duplicate have been evolving at a high rate. In addition, we found that F-box genes exhibited functional specificity based on GO analysis, and most of the F-box genes were significantly enriched in the protein binding (GO: 0005515) term, supporting that F-box genes might play a critical role for gene regulation in pear. Transcriptome and digital expression profiles revealed that F-box genes are involved in the development of multiple pear tissues. Overall, these results will set stage for elaborating the biological role of F-box genes in pear and other plants.},

An incomplete diallel design was used to investigate the relationship between the global framework of differential gene expression and heterosis. It was found that the genes belonging to MONO pattern (i.e., genes expressed in both parental lines and in hybrid) was the highest in percentage among the total five patterns and illustrated that the properties of differentially expressed genes are not entirely responsible for heterosis. Furthermore, a larger number of differentially expressed genes in hybrid, which serves as a major reservoir for generating novel phenotypes that exhibit heterosis of certain agronomic traits during early development and differentiation of maize ear. Moreover, there were some silent genesin hybrids that are responsible for the arrest or abortion of spikelets and for the increase in kernels weight.},

Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence to demonstrate that BES1 interacts with MAX2 and acts as its substrate to regulate SL-responsive gene expression. Additional AtD14, a putative receptor of SLs, can promote BES1 degradation. Knockdown of BES1 and its homologs dramatically suppressed the branching phenotype of max2-1 mutant. These results portray an SL signaling cascade from the putative receptor to downstream transcription factors. In addition, we demonstrate that the SL and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathways distinctly regulate the same transcription factor, BES1, to control specific developmental processes.},

Analysis of spectral data across population scale cohorts, however, is precluded by day-to-day nonlinear signal drifts in LC retention time or batch effects that complicate comparison of thousands of untargeted peaks. To date, there exists no efficient means of visualization and quantitative assessment of signal drift, correction of drift when present, and automated filtering of unstable spectral features, particularly across thousands of data files in population scale experiments. Herein, we report the development of a set of R-based scripts that allow for pre- and postprocessing of raw LC-MS data. These methods can be integrated with existing data analysis workflows by providing initial preprocessing bulk nonlinear retention time correction at the raw data level. Further, this approach provides postprocessing visualization and quantification of peak alignment accuracy, as well as peak-reliability-based parsing of processed data through hierarchical clustering of signal profiles. In a metabolomics data set derived from {$\sim$}3000 human plasma samples, we find that application of our alignment tools resulted in substantial improvement in peak alignment accuracy, automated data filtering, and ultimately statistical power for detection of metabolite correlates of clinical measures. These tools will enable metabolomics studies of population scale cohorts.},

  abstract = {Central to plant microRNA (miRNA) biology is the identification of functional miRNA-target interactions (MTIs). However, the complementarity basis of bioinformatic target prediction results in mostly false positives, and the degree of complementarity does not equate with regulation. Here, we develop a bioinformatic workflow named TRUEE (Targets Ranked Using Experimental Evidence) that ranks MTIs on the extent to which they are subjected to miRNA-mediated cleavage. It sorts predicted targets into high (HE) and low evidence (LE) groupings based on the frequency and strength of miRNA-guided cleavage degradome signals across multiple degradome experiments. From this, each target is assigned a numerical value, termed a Category Score, ranking the extent to which it is subjected to miRNA-mediated cleavage. As a proof-of-concept, the 428 Arabidopsis miRNAs annotated in miRBase were processed through the TRUEE pipeline to determine the miRNA 'targetome'. The majority of high-ranking Category Score targets corresponded to highly conserved MTIs, validating the workflow. Very few Arabidopsis-specific, Brassicaceae-specific, or Conserved-passenger miRNAs had HE targets with high Category Scores. In total, only several hundred MTIs were found to have Category Scores characteristic of currently known physiologically significance MTIs. Although non-exhaustive, clearly the number of functional MTIs is much narrower than many studies claim. Therefore, using TRUEE to numerically rank targets \,directly on experimental evidence has given insights into the scope of the functional miRNA targetome of Arabidopsis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In maize hybrid breeding, complementary pools of parental lines with reshuffled genetic variants are established for superior hybrid performance. To comprehensively decipher the genetics of heterosis, we present a new design of multiple linked F1 populations with 42,840 F1 maize hybrids, generated by crossing a synthetic population of 1428 maternal lines with 30 elite testers from diverse genetic backgrounds and phenotyped for agronomic traits. RESULTS: We show that, although yield heterosis is correlated with the widespread, minor-effect epistatic QTLs, it may be resulted from a few major-effect additive and dominant QTLs in early developmental stages. Floral transition is probably one critical stage for heterosis formation, in which epistatic QTLs are activated by paternal contributions of alleles that counteract the recessive, deleterious maternal alleles. These deleterious alleles, while rare, epistatically repress other favorable QTLs. We demonstrate this with one example, showing that Brachytic2 represses the Ubiquitin3 locus in the maternal lines; in hybrids, the paternal allele alleviates this repression, which in turn recovers the height of the plant and enhances the weight of the ear. Finally, we propose a molecular design breeding by manipulating key genes underlying the transition from vegetative-to-reproductive growth. CONCLUSION: The new population design is used to dissect the genetic basis of heterosis which accelerates maize molecular design breeding by diminishing deleterious epistatic interactions.},

The roles of flavonol synthases (FLSs) and flavonoid 3{${'}$},5{${'}$}-hydroxylase (F3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H) in M biosynthesis in Morella rubra, a member of the Myricaceae rich in M-based flavonols, were investigated. The level of MrFLS transcripts alone did not correlate well with the accumulation of M-based flavonols. However, combined transcript data for MrFLS1 and MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H showed a good correlation with the accumulation of M-based flavonols in different tissues of M. rubra. Recombinant MrFLS1 and MrFLS2 proteins showed strong activity with dihydroquercetin (DHQ), dihydrokaempferol (DHK), and dihydromyricetin (DHM) as substrates, while recombinant MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H protein preferred converting K to M, amongst a range of substrates. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) overexpressing 35S::MrFLSs produced elevated levels of K-based and Q-based flavonols without affecting M-based flavonol levels, while tobacco overexpressing 35S::MrF3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H accumulated significantly higher levels of M-based flavonols. We conclude that M accumulation in M. rubra is affected by gene expression and enzyme specificity of FLS and F3{${'}$}5{${'}$}H as well as substrate availability.

  abstract = {Methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a prevalent DNA modification found in many organisms. Sequential oxidation of 5mC by ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases results in a cascade of additional epigenetic marks and promotes demethylation of DNA in mammals1,2. However, the enzymatic activity and function of TET homologues in other eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here we show that the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains a 5mC-modifying enzyme (CMD1) that is a TET homologue and catalyses the conjugation of a glyceryl moiety to the methyl group of 5mC through a carbon\textendash carbon bond, resulting in two stereoisomeric nucleobase products. The catalytic activity of CMD1 requires Fe(ii) and the integrity of its binding motif His-X-Asp, which is conserved in Fe-dependent dioxygenases3. However, unlike previously described TET enzymes, which use 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate4, CMD1 uses l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as an essential co-substrate. Vitamin C donates the glyceryl moiety to 5mC with concurrent formation of glyoxylic acid and CO2. The vitamin-C-derived DNA modification is present in the genome of wild-type C. reinhardtii but at a substantially lower level in a CMD1 mutant strain. The fitness of CMD1 mutant cells during exposure to high light levels is reduced. LHCSR3, a gene that is critical for the protection of C. reinhardtii from photo-oxidative damage under high light conditions, is hypermethylated and downregulated in CMD1 mutant cells compared to wild-type cells, causing a reduced capacity for photoprotective non-photochemical quenching. Our study thus identifies a eukaryotic DNA base modification that is catalysed by a divergent TET homologue and unexpectedly derived from vitamin C, and describes its role as a potential epigenetic mark that may counteract DNA methylation in the regulation of photosynthesis.},

We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of complementation for segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.},

In the MIM experiment, multiple predicted metabolite ions were monitored in both Q1 and Q3. The collision energy in Q2 was set to a low value to minimize fragmentation. Results from analyzing ritonavir metabolites in rat hepatocytes demonstrate that MIM-EPI was capable of targeting a larger number of metabolites regardless of their fragmentation and retained sensitivity and duty cycle similar to multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-EPI. MIM-based scanning methods were shown to be particularly useful in several applications. First, MIM-EPI enabled the sensitive detection and MS/MS acquisition of up to 100 predicted metabolites. Second, MIM-MRM-EPI was better than MRM-EPI in the analysis of metabolites that undergo either predictable or unpredictable fragmentation pathways. Finally, a combination of MIM-EPI and full-scan MS (EMS), as an alternative to EMS-EPI, was well suited for routine in vitro metabolite profiling. Overall, MIM-EPI significantly enhanced the metabolite identification capability of the hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap LC/MS.},

  abstract = {In this study, we determined the crystal structures of the apoform, binary, and ternary complexes of the Arabidopsis alkenal double bond reductase encoded by At5g16970. This protein, one of 11 homologues in Arabidopsis thaliana, is most closely related to the Pinus taeda phenylpropenal double bond reductase, involved in, for example, heartwood formation. Both enzymes also have essential roles in plant defense, and can function by catalyzing the reduction of the 7-8-double bond of phenylpropanal substrates, such as p-coumaryl and coniferyl aldehydes in vitro. At5g16970 is also capable of reducing toxic substrates with the same alkenal functionality, such as 4-hydroxy-(2E)-nonenal. The overall fold of At5g16970 is similar to that of the zinc-independent medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, the members of which have two domains and are dimeric in nature, i.e. in contrast to their original classification as being zinc-containing oxidoreductases. As provisionally anticipated from the kinetic data, the shape of the binding pocket can readily accommodate p-coumaryl aldehyde, coniferyl aldehyde, 4-hydroxy-(2E)-nonenal, and 2-alkenals. However, the enzyme kinetic data among these potential substrates differ, favoring p-coumaryl aldehyde. Tyr-260 is provisionally proposed to function as a general acid/base for hydride transfer. A catalytic mechanism for this reduction, and its applicability to related important detoxification mammalian proteins, is also proposed.},

In most tested eukaryotes and some bacteria, ascarosides are metabolized into derivatives with shortened fatty acid side chains, analogous to ascaroside biosynthesis in nematodes. In plants and C. elegans, labeled ascarosides were additionally integrated into larger, modular metabolites, and use of different ascaroside stereoisomers revealed the stereospecificity of their biosynthesis. The finding that nematodes extensively metabolize ascarosides taken up from the environment suggests that pheromone editing may play a role in conspecific and interspecific interactions. Moreover, our results indicate that plants, animals, and microorganisms may interact with associated nematodes via manipulation of ascaroside signaling.},

  abstract = {Scope In this study, whether amination is a novel metabolic pathway of myricetin, one of the major dietary flavonoids found in fruits, vegetables, and tea, and whether the aminated metabolite of myricetin remains bioactive, are investigated. Methods and results It is found that myricetin with a vic-trihydroxyl group on the B ring can chemically react with ammonia via the formation of myricetin quinone to generate the aminated product in vitro. As expected, the amination occurs on position 4\textasciiacute{} of the B-ring of myricetin. The structure of this new product is confirmed by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and is named 4\textasciiacute -NH2-myricetin. Using the synthetic 4\textasciiacute -NH2-myricetin as a standard, the presence of this compound is searched for in fecal samples collected from myricetin-treated mice using LC\textendash MS, and 4\textasciiacute -NH2-myricetin is confirmed as the metabolite of myricetin in mice for the first time. Furthermore, two metabolites of myricetin, the mono-methylated myricetin and the microbial-derived metabolite 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid, are confirmed to be aminated in vivo based on LC\textendash MS data analysis. After administration of different doses of myricetin through oral gavage, the amination of myricetin shows a dose-dependent response in feces. A similar trend is observed for the amination of the mono-methylated myricetin, but not for the microbial-derived metabolite 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid. In plasma, the trend of a dose-dependent response for the amination of myricetin and its mono methylated metabolite is observed, and the plasma concentration of the aminated 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylacetic acid at 200 mg kg\textendash 1 dose is significantly higher than those at the 100 and 400 mg kg\textendash 1 doses. Interestingly, it is observed that the aminated myricetin retains the anti-inflammatory activity of myricetin. Conclusion This result demonstrates that amination is a novel biotransformation mechanism of myricetin to produce aminated metabolites.},

  abstract = {The F-box domain containing proteins is one of the super protein families in Eukaryotic cells including yeast, plant, and mammals. For example, the model plant Arabidopsis and Medicago genomes contain nearly 700 and 1000 F-box protein encoding genes, respectively, which are the two largest gene families in the plant kingdom. Excluding the N-terminal signature, the approximately 40\textendash 50 conserved amino-acid F-box motif and their C-terminal protein\textendash protein interaction domains define the different F-box protein subfamilies. Most of the F-box proteins studied so far can interact with SKP proteins, together with Cullin and Rbx1 to form the SCF complexes, which are the classic and most well-studied E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Through the F-box protein C-terminal domains, the SCF complexes confer the specificity of selective protein ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome, and this process is routinely termed as the ubiquitin\textendash protease pathway (UPP). UPP-mediated protein degradation is one of the key regulatory mechanisms for protein stability and is the major protein degradation pathway for the majority of the intracellular proteins. Since the first plant F-box gene, UFO (Unusual Floral Organs) was isolated in 1995, a collection of about 20 plant F-box genes have been identified and functionally characterised. Proteins encoded by plant F-box genes have been revealed to be functionally diverse and play a variety of roles in developmental processes including plant hormonal signal transduction, floral development, secondary metabolism, senescence, circadian rhythms, and responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In recent years, with the rapid improvements of new genome sequencing technologies, hundreds of F-box genes from every sequenced plant species have been identified. Comparing with the large number of F-box genes identified so far, only a handful of them have been studied in detail and the functional characterisation of the majority of F-box gene families remains unknown. This article summarises our current understanding of plant F-box proteins, including their classification and the pathways that they regulate, and seeks to lay the foundation for a systematical investigation of F-box genes in plants.},

In vivo, PVPs could significantly reduce the weight gain and the increases in serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C levels observed in rats fed a high-fat diet; they could also significantly increase serum GSH-Px activity, reduce the content of MDA and TNF-{$\alpha$} and decrease abdominal fat volume in rats. Furthermore, PVPs exerted a repairing effect on morphological and structural damage in liver tissue cells in hyperlipidaemic rats fed a high-fat diet. PVPs improved lipid metabolism disorder in rats. Alanine, threonine, succinic acid, proline, inositol and arachidonic acid levels in the serum were considered potential biomarkers involved in amino acid, glucose, energy and lipid metabolism. Therefore, PVPs may interfere with hyperlipidaemia through anti-lipid peroxidation effects, attenuation of inflammation and regulation of glucose, amino acid, energy and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maize (Zea mays) ear length, which is an important yield component, exhibits strong heterosis. Understanding the potential molecular mechanisms of ear-length heterosis is critical for efficient yield-related breeding. RESULTS: Here, a joint netted pattern, including six parent-hybrid triplets, was designed on the basis of two maize lines harboring long (T121 line) and short (T126 line) ears. Global transcriptional profiling of young ears (containing meristem) was performed. Multiple comparative analyses revealed that 874 differentially expressed genes are mainly responsible for the ear-length variation between T121 and T126 lines. Among them, four key genes, Zm00001d049958, Zm00001d027359, Zm00001d048502 and Zm00001d052138, were identified as being related to meristem development, which corroborated their roles in the superior additive genetic effects on ear length in T121 line. Non-additive expression patterns were used to identify candidate genes related to ear-length heterosis. A non-additively expressed gene (Zm00001d050649) was associated with the timing of meristematic phase transition and was determined to be the homolog of tomato SELF PRUNING, which assists SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS in driving yield-related heterosis, indicating that Zm00001d050649 is a potential contributor to drive heterotic effect on ear length. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inbred parents provide genetic and heterotic effects on the ear lengths of their corresponding F1 hybrids through two independent pathways. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the transcriptional regulation of ear length and improve the understanding of ear-length heterosis in maize.},

Here, A. bidentata polysaccharides (ABPs) were confirmed to have anti-osteoporosis effects. This study discovered biomarkers by comparing normal and osteoporosis rats and evaluated the effects of ABPs on osteoporosis based on the UPLC/Q-TOF-MS-based metabolomics analysis. We could then predict the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of metabolomics. Osteoporotic rats were treated with ABPs, and serum was then sampled for metabolic analysis. Glutarylcarnitine, lysoPC (18:1) and 9-cis-retinoic acid were identified as biomarkers. The ABPs could significantly increase these biomarkers, and this indicated that ABPs curing osteoporosis regulated lipid metabolism. The UPLC/Q-TOF-MS-based metabolomics analysis offered a potential strategy to evaluate the anti-osteoporosis effects of ABPs and to explain the relative mechanisms. Furthermore, the ABPs have good potential for treating osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Untargeted methods are typically used in the detection and discovery of small organic compounds in metabolomics research, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography\textendash high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) is one of the most commonly used platforms for untargeted metabolomics. Although they are non-biased and have high coverage, untargeted approaches suffer from unsatisfying repeatability and a requirement for complex data processing. Targeted metabolomics based on triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQMS) could be a complementary tool because of its high sensitivity, high specificity and excellent quantification ability. However, it is usually applicable to known compounds: compounds whose identities are known and/or are expected to be present in the analyzed samples. Pseudotargeted metabolomics merges the advantages of untargeted and targeted metabolomics and can act as an alternative to the untargeted method. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of pseudotargeted metabolomics using UHPLC-TQMS. An in-depth, untargeted metabolomics experiment involving multiple UHPLC-HRMS runs with MS at different collision energies (both positive and negative) is performed using a mixture obtained using small amounts of the analyzed samples. XCMS, CAMERA and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)-Ion Pair Finder are used to find and annotate peaks and choose transitions that will be used to analyze the real samples. A set of internal standards is used to correct for variations in retention time. High coverage and high-performance quantitative analysis can be realized. The entire protocol takes \textasciitilde 5 d to complete and enables the simultaneously semiquantitative analysis of 800\textendash 1,300 metabolites.},

Grafting has crucial impacts on various phenotypes of the cultivar including phenology, biotic and abiotic resistance, berry metabolome and coloring, however, the genetics and regulation mechanisms are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic, metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles at three stages (45, 75 and 105~days after flowering) of the Crimson Seedless (Vitis vinifera, CS) cultivar grafted to four rootstocks (three heterografting: CS/101\textendash 14, CS/SO4, CS/110R and one self-grafting CS/CS) with an own-rooted grafting-free Crimson Seedless (CS) used as the control. All the heterografting had a significant effect on berry reddening as early as \textasciitilde 45~days after flowering. The grafting of rootstocks promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in grape berries. The metabolomic features showed that Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-glucosid, Malvidin 3-O-glucoside, Peonidin 3-O-glucoside and Petunidin 3-O-glucoside were the pigments responsible for the purplish-red color peels. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that anthocyanins biosynthetic related genes from the upstream (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) to the downstream (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase and anthocyanidin synthase) were upregulated with the accumulations of anthocyanins in heterografted plants: CS/101\textendash 14, CS/SO4 and CS/110R. At the same time, all these genes were also highly expressed and more anthocyanin was accumulated in self-grafted CS/CS samples compared to own-rooted grafting-free CS samples, suggesting that self-grafting might also have promoted berry reddening in grapevine. Our results provide global transcriptomic and metabolomic features in the regulation of berry coloring under different grafting conditions for improving the berry quality in viticulture.},

The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions3,4. Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19\,million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24\% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.},

  abstract = {Jasmine [Jasminum sambac (L.) Aiton] flowers usually bloom and release their fragrance at night. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of aroma formation during flowering in postharvest jasmine are still poorly understood. Here, we profiled the volatile metabolome, multi-flux full-length sequencing, and transcriptome analysis to investigate volatile biosynthesis and global transcriptomic changes in postharvest flowering jasmine. A total of 102 volatiles were identified. Of these, 16 volatiles were considered key odorants of jasmine flowers. Linalool, {$\alpha$}-farnesene, d-nerolidol, geraniol, {$\alpha$}-cadinol, benyzl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzyl acetate, benzyl benzoate, 3-hexen-1-ol benzoate, and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate play decisive roles in the typical jasmine fragrance, while benzeneacetaldehyde, benzoic acid, methyl anthranilate, methyl 2-(methylamino) benzoate, and (E)-2-hexenal modify the aroma of jasmine. Meanwhile, we built the first reference full-length transcriptome of postharvest jasmine flowers, which had 366,081 non-redundant isoforms. Among them, 280,326 (76.57 \%) were annotated with at least one hit in the NT, NR, Swissprot, KEGG, KOG, Pfam, and GO databases. Combined with second-generation transcriptome analysis, we identified 52 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) involved in terpenoid metabolic pathways and 28 DETs involved in phenylpropanoid/benzenoid metabolic pathway, and 31 {$\beta$}-glucosidase transcripts may be related to aroma formation of postharvest jasmine during flowering. In addition, the expression of 42 heat shock protein (HSP) transcripts was positively correlated with the content of 11 key odorants, as revealed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The present results advance the knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of aroma formation in postharvest jasmine during flowering and provide an abundant genetic resource for further studies on gene discovery in jasmine.},

  abstract = {Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments and analytical strategies have brought about great progress in targeted metabolomics analysis. This methodology is now capable of performing precise targeted measurement of dozens or hundreds of metabolites in complex biological samples. Classic targeted quantification assay using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode has been the foundation of high-quality metabolite quantitation. However, utilization of this strategy in biological studies has been limited by its relatively low metabolite coverage and throughput capacity. A number of methods for large-scale targeted metabolomics assay which have been developed overcome these limitations. These strategies have enabled extended metabolite coverage which is defined as targeting of large numbers of metabolites, while maintaining reliable quantification performance. These recently developed techniques thus bridge the gap between traditional targeted metabolite quantification and untargeted metabolomics profiling, and have proven to be powerful tools for metabolomics study. Although the LC-MRM-MS strategy has been used widely in large-scale metabolomics quantification analysis due to its fast scan speed and ideal analytic stability, there are still drawbacks which are due to the low resolution of the triple quadrupole instruments used for MRM assays. New approaches have been developed to expand the options for large-scale targeted metabolomics study, using high-resolution instruments such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). MRM and PRM-based techniques are now attractive strategies for quantitative metabolomics analysis and high-throughput biomarker discovery. Here we provide an overview of the major developments in LC-MS-based strategies for large-scale targeted metabolomics quantification in biological samples. The advantages of LC-MRM/PRM-MS based analytical strategies which may be used in multiplexed and high throughput quantitation for a wide range of metabolites are highlighted. In particular, PRM and MRM strategies are compared, and we summarize the work flow commonly used for large-scale targeted metabolomics analysis including sample preparation, LC separation and data analysis, as well as recent applications in biological studies.},
